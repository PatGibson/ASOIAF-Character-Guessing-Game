[1] He has a tendency to state the obvious [2] and a loose tongue. [3]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones  While Lady Catelyn Stark is unconscious following the attempt on Bran Stark 's life, Robb Stark names Hallis the new captain of the guards at Winterfell . He succeeds Jory Cassel , who accompanied Lord Eddard Stark to King's Landing when Ned was appointed Hand of the King by Robert I Baratheon . Hallis accompanies Robb on visits to distant holdfasts in Catelyn's absence, making Bran in his sickbed believe that Robb spends more time now with Hallis and Theon Greyjoy than with his own brothers. He also guards Robb while he is receiving Tyrion Lannister upon Tyrion's return from the Wall . [4]  Following the injury of Lord Eddard at the hands of House Lannister guards led by Ser Jaime Lannister , Hallis, Theon and Maester Luwin counsel Robb before he calls his bannermen. [5]  When Bran goes on his first ride outside Winterfell since his fall, Hallis assigns several guards to accompany him and Robb, to Bran's dismay. [5]  Robb decides to lead the army going south to hold the Neck and assist the Tullys in their fight against the Lannisters. Bran muses that Robb could have given command of the forces to Hallis, Theon or one of his bannerman, as urged by Luwin, but Robb has decided to lead the men himself, leaving Bran as acting Lord of Winterfell. When Greatjon Umber threatens Robb over a disagreement, Hallis moves to intercept him before he reaches Robb with a drawn greatsword, but Hallis is knocked down by the much larger man. Hallis carries the banner of House Stark when the forces are leaving Winterfell. [6]  During the battle in the Whispering Wood , Hallis personally commands the guards protecting Catelyn, after asking for the honor. Catelyn notes that he has a tendency of stating the obvious when he identifies sounds used as signals as indication that the forces led by Ser Jaime Lannister are approaching. When Jaime is brought before her, he introduces him as the Kingslayer . [7]   A Clash of Kings  Hallis guards Catelyn when she goes south to meet Renly Baratheon and negotiate a possible alliance. When they approach Renly's host at Bitterbridge , Hallis notices noise that turns out to come from a melee held among Renly's men . He points this out to Catelyn, making her again aware that he has a penchant for loudly stating the obvious. [2]  Hallis accompanies Catelyn to a parley between Renly and his brother Stannis Baratheon at Storm's End . After the parley fails, he plays dice with some Stark men, informing them about the outcome and that there is going to be a battle between Renly's and Stannis's forces at dawn. When Catelyn is asked about this by Lucas Blackwood , she confirms Hallis's words but notes by herself that her guard has a loose tongue. [3]  After Renly has been murdered and his camp is in uproar, Hallis asks Catelyn about the upcoming battle, receiving the answer that there is not going to be one. Catelyn commands her escort to lead her and Brienne of Tarth out of the camp fast, before Renly's men start to look for the two women who were with their king when he died. [8]  Upon their return to Riverrun , Hallis points out the Lannister men that have been hanged in their absence with their bodies dangling from the walls of the castle now. They turn out to be men who escorted Ser Cleos Frey when he returned from King's Landing with peace terms set by Tyrion Lannister ; they were hanged for trying to help Ser Jaime Lannister escape. Cleos has also brought the remains of Lord Eddard Stark with him. Catelyn gives orders to transport them to Winterfell , guarded by Hallis, and to bury them in the crypt of Winterfell . [9]  Unbeknownst to Catelyn, ironmen led by Victarion Greyjoy have already moved to take Moat Cailin and Theon Greyjoy is on his way to take Winterfell as well. [10] [11]   A Storm of Swords  While on the way to the wedding of Lord Edmure Tully with Roslin Frey at the Twins , the force led by Robb Stark comes through Whispering Wood . Spotting some skeletons of soldiers who died in the earlier battle, Catelyn wonders what happened to her husband's remains after she sent Hallis with an honor guard north with them. She does not know whether Hallis and his men were able to reach home before the ironmen took Moat Cailin and Winterfell. [12]   A Dance with Dragons  Lady Barbrey Dustin tells Theon Greyjoy that should Ned Stark's bones emerge from the Neck , the escorts will be prevented from going north of Barrowton .
