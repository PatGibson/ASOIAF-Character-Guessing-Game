Devan's cheeks and chin are covered with a fuzz of blond hair, and although, according to Devan's father Davos , the beard would "have shamed a proper peach", Devan is fiercely proud of it. [4]  Devan takes great pride in being a squire to King Stannis Baratheon . [5] As a royal squire, Devan dresses in a squire's raiment, a cream-colored doublet with Stannis's sigil sewn on the breast. Devan's father, Davos , feels Devan looks splendid in his raiment. [2]  Devan is called brave by Salladhor Saan [6] and described as "a good boy" by Stannis Baratheon, who claims the boy is much like his father. [7]  Melisandre considers him to be "quick and smart and able". [5] He is a diligent boy, who has learned to read and write. [2] [4] According to the master-at-arms at Dragonstone , Devan is showing promise with sword and lance. [4]  After Stannis converts to the Lord of Light , Devan does the same, [8] and becomes a diligent follower. [4] Although he fears the priestess Melisandre, he is half in love with her too. [5]   Recent Events  A Clash of Kings  According to Salladhor Saan , Devan is one of the last of Stannis Baratheon 's men to be taken off by the Lyseni galleys at the Battle of the Blackwater , when the tide in battle turns against Stannis. He reportedly stayed by King Stannis's side throughout the battle. [6]   A Storm of Swords  Devan has safely returned to Dragonstone , where he continues his lessons by Maester Pylos , alongside Princess Shireen Baratheon and the bastard son of the late King Robert I Baratheon , Edric Storm . [4]   A Feast for Crows  When Stannis goes north to the Wall , Devan, as his squire, accompanies him and is part of his retinue at Castle Black . [9]   A Dance with Dragons  When Stannis merches south to face the Boltons , Devan remains at the Wall to attend Melisandre because she does not wish for Davos to lose any more sons. Devan is unhappy to be left behind and believes the boy thinks he is being punished for some mistake he or his father have made.
