 Appearance and Character 
 See also:  Images of Robert Arryn 
 Robert is six years old but small and painfully thin for his age. He is pale with brown hair and big eyes [1]  that are runny. [5]  Robert has spindly arms and legs, a soft concave chest, a little belly, [6]  and his skin is splotchy. [5] 
 Young Robert is spoiled and whiny, prone to crying when his dolls are taken away [1]  or damaged. [5]  He enjoys puppetry shows, [7]  as well as songs and stories about animals [8]  and the  Winged Knight . [6]  Robert likes to play  come-into-my-castle ,  hopfrog , and  spin-the-sword , although the court of the  Eyrie  allows him to win. [8]  He enjoys being told how strong he is, but does not know how to ride. [6] 
 Robert is afflicted with a  disease  that causes frequent seizures. Maester  Colemon  bleeds him with leeches [5] [9]  and administers  dreamwine  and  milk of the poppy  to help Robert sleep. [9]   Sweetmilk  helps Robert with shaking, but Colemon is cautious because continuous use of  sweetsleep  has an increasing level of toxicity. [6]  He is intellectually and physically stunted, and is not weaned from his mother's breast. [1]  Because Robert is delicate,  Lysa Arryn  keeps a whipping boy at the Eyrie. [5]  Robert is distrustful of Ser  Lyn Corbray . [9] 
 For formal occasions Robert dons a doublet of cream and blue, [9]  while in cold weather he wears sky-blue velvet, a chain of gold and sapphires, and a white bearskin cloak. [6] 
 
 History 
 Robert has been sickly all his days. [1]  Prince  Joffrey Baratheon  calls him cruel names and once slapped Robert with a wooden sword. [8]  The boy was brought to the  Vale of Arryn  from  King's Landing  at the age of six. [6] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Game of Thrones 
 Robert became  Defender of the Vale  upon the death of his father, Lord  Jon Arryn , but does not receive his father's title of  Warden of the East , as King  Robert I Baratheon  grants it instead to Ser  Jaime Lannister . [4] [10]  The court at the  Eyrie  instead refers to Robert Arryn as the True Warden of the East. [1] 
 Before his ascension, Lord  Tywin Lannister  offered to take young Robert as his ward, something he had never offered to anyone else. Lord  Eddard Stark  suspects Tywin made this offer in order to seize Robert Arryn as a hostage. King Robert planned to accept the offer but Lady  Lysa Arryn  fled from  King's Landing  to the Vale with her son to avoid this. [4] 
 Robert's mother, Lady Lysa, rules the Vale as  regent  in his name, but makes no effort to school him in the governance of his realm. He presides over the trial of  Tyrion Lannister  for the attempted murder of  Bran Stark . He is upset when  Bronn  defeats Ser  Vardis Egen  in Tyrion's  trial by combat  as he wanted to "make him fly" through the  Moon Door . [7]  Lysa refuses the offer of her sister,  Catelyn Stark , to foster Robert at  Winterfell  for a few years. [11] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
 Tywin, the  Hand of the King , agrees to restores the title of  Warden of the East  to  House Arryn , in return for  Petyr Baelish  marrying Robert's widowed mother, Lysa, and bringing the Vale to the king's peace. [12]   Marillion  sings Robert to sleep each night. [5] 
 Following the death of King  Joffrey I Baratheon  at his  royal wedding , Petyr smuggles  Sansa Stark  to the  Fingers , where he marries Lysa. Lady Arryn tells Sansa that she intends to marry her to Robert once Sansa's husband,  Tyrion Lannister , is executed for Joffrey's murder. [13] 
 At the Eyrie, Robert uses his doll to destroy the snow castle replica of  Winterfell  made by his cousin, Sansa, in her guise of Alayne Stone. When Sansa rips the doll, Robert has a fit and is taken away by Maester  Colemon . After an altercation between Sansa and Lysa, Petyr pushes Lysa through the  Moon Door  and blames Marillion. [5] 
 
 A Feast for Crows 
 Upon the death of Robert's mother,  Petyr Baelish  assumes the position of  Lord Protector of the Vale , claiming the rule of the  Vale of Arryn  and the guardianship of Lord Robert through his brief marriage to Lysa. [2]  Robert has become even more emotional and unstable after his mother's death, and has become highly attached to Alayne, who has taken on a surrogate maternal role with regards to him. Robert states he is unable to sleep because of the singing of the maimed Marillion. [2]  At Petyr's suggestion, Maester Colemon has been using  sweetsleep  to treat Robert's seizures, although he is also worried about the potentially fatal side-effects of using it too often. [6]  Robert is now fearful of blades, so Petyr allows the boy's fine hair to grow as long as a girl's. [6]  Robert becomes fond of lemoncakes, possibly because they are a favorite treat of Alayne. [6] 
 Seated on the  weirwood  throne, Robert hosts Lord  Nestor Royce . When Sansa, disguised as Alayne Stone, tells Nestor that Lysa had been killed by Marillion, Robert has another fit. Ser  Lothor Brune  is kicked in the face during the boy's spasms. [2] 
 Several of the more prominent nobles of the Vale sign a declaration to oust Petyr from the  Eyrie  and assume the rearing and training of Robert, calling themselves the  Lords Declarant . [14] [9]  When they come to the Eyrie, Robert objects to the arrival of Ser  Lyn Corbray  and flings his porridge, which strikes Colemon. [9]  The Lords Declarant want Robert to be fostered with Lord  Yohn Royce  at  Runestone , where Robert can be taught by Ser  Samwell Stone  and Septon  Lucos , healed by Maester  Helliweg , and befriended by his cousin,  Harrold Hardyng . [9]  Petyr convinces his rivals to grant him a year, however, and Robert later is a gracious host to  Benedar Belmore ,  Gilwood Hunter ,  Horton Redfort ,  Symond Templeton , and  Anya Waynwood . [9] 
 Petyr invites  Gyles Grafton  and  Terrance Lynderly  to be companions and squires for Robert. [9] [6]  With the approach of winter, the Arryn court descends from the Eyrie to the  Gates of the Moon . Sansa and  Mya Stone  help the scared Robert down the  Giant's Lance . Once at the Gates of the Moon, however, Petyr tells Sansa he intends to marry her to Harry the Heir once the sickly Robert inevitably dies. [6] 
 
 The Winds of Winter 
 
 
 
   Warning    This information has thus far been released in a sample chapter for  The Winds of Winter , and might therefore not be in finalized form. Keep in mind that the content as described below is still subject to change. 
 Robert immediately approves of  Alayne Stone's  suggestion he be protected by an order inspired by his hero, the  Winged Knight , with a  tourney  choosing the eight members of the new  Brotherhood of Winged Knights . Robert tells Alayne he wants to marry her, but she says he cannot as she is baseborn. Robert dislikes his cousin, Ser  Harrold Hardyng , thinking they are waiting for him to die so Harry the Heir can take over the Eyrie. [15] 
 
 Conflicting accounts about plans for fostering Robert 
 In the early books, various characters give conflicting accounts on whether Robert was meant to be  fostered  by  Stannis Baratheon  at  Dragonstone  or instead by  House Lannister  at  Casterly Rock , suggesting some change of plans linked to his father's death.
 
 King  Robert I Baratheon  wanted to give Robert Arryn to be fostered by  Tywin Lannister  at Casterly Rock.  Lysa Arryn  refused and fled  King's Landing  hurriedly, going back to the  Eyrie  with her son. [4] 
 Queen  Cersei Lannister  seems to believe that  Jon Arryn  also wanted Tywin to foster Robert, and states that Lysa fled to the Eyrie with her son. [16] 
 A potboy that used to work for Jon believes though that shortly before his death Lord Arryn was planning for Stannis to foster Robert at Dragonstone. [17] 
 Ser  Brynden Tully  believes that arrangements were made for Robert to be raised in Casterly Rock and makes no mention of Dragonstone. [1] 
 Maester  Colemon  agrees with the version that claims Dragonstone for Robert's fostering and insists that it is so, despite hearing a conflicting history from Lysa, by way of  Catelyn Stark . [7] 
 Lord  Walder Frey  insists that Jon had made arrangements to raise Robert at Dragonstone and not Casterly Rock. [18]  Catelyn grows uneasy at having that statement reinforced once again, all the more so because Walder affirms that Lysa was well aware of those plans, albeit strongly opposed to them as well. [18]  If Walder is saying the truth, then Lysa lied to her (and presumably to Brynden the Blackfish as well). 
 Stannis confirms that Jon had asked him to foster Robert at Dragonstone. [19] 
 Grand Maester  Pycelle  informs  Tyrion Lannister  that Jon was sending his wife back to the Eyrie and his son to be fostered on Dragonstone. [20] 
 Lysa eventually admits to know both of Jon's desire to send Robert to Dragonstone and of King Robert Baratheon's plans to send him to Casterly Rock; she seems to believe that the latter is motivated by a request from Cersei. [5] 
 As the history stands at the end of  A Dance with Dragons , it would seem that Lord  Jon Arryn  planned to send Robert to  Dragonstone  to protect him from his enemies, but Queen  Cersei Lannister  found out and convinced King  Robert I Baratheon  to interfere and send young Robert to  Casterly Rock  instead. The main evidence is Cersei's conversation with Ser  Jaime Lannister  in the  First Keep . [16]  It would seem that Jaime is unaware of the original Dragonstone plans.
 
 Quotes by Robert 
 The  bad little man . Mother, can I  make him fly ? I want to see him fly. [7]

 Robert : I could do it, but I don't choose to. Tell Mya I am going to stay abed. Perhaps I will come down on the morrow, if I feel better. Today is too cold out, and my head hurts. You can have some  sweetmilk  too, and I'll tell  Gretchel  to bring us some honeycombs to eat. We'll sleep and kiss and play games, and you can read me about the  Winged Knight . [6]

 Quotes about Robert 
 Lord Robert. Six years old, sickly, and prone to weep if you take his dolls away.  Jon Arryn 's trueborn heir, by all the gods, yet there are some who say he is too weak to sit his father's seat. [1] 
  –  Brynden Tully  to  Catelyn Stark 
 
 
 Isn't he beautiful? And strong too, don't you believe the things you hear. Jon knew. The seed is strong, he told me. His last words. He kept saying Robert's name, and he grabbed my arm so hard he left marks. Tell them, the seed is strong. His seed. He wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be. [1] 
  –  Lysa Arryn  to  Catelyn Stark 
 
 
 The boy is utterly without discipline. He will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from  his mother  for a time. [7] 
  -  Catelyn Stark  to  Rodrik Cassel 
 
 
 The boy is weak and sickly. [19]
