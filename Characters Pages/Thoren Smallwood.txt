 A Clash of Kings 
 According to  Jon Snow , Thoren was a henchman of Ser  Alliser Thorne , the former master-at-arms of  Castle Black , and Thoren dislikes Jon and  Samwell Tarly . [2]  Following the death of Ser  Jaremy Rykker , command of the  rangers  falls to Thoren, who takes Jaremy's heavy breastplate and sable-trimmed cloak for himself. [7]  Thoren attempts to convince Lord Commander  Jeor Mormont  that he should command the upcoming  great ranging , not Jeor. He is rebuffed by the Lord Commander, who insists that  Benjen Stark  is still  First Ranger  until his fate is confirmed. [2] 
 Thoren is one of the senior officers during the expedition  beyond the Wall , commanding the rangers. In the column, he commands the vanguard. [4]  At  Whitetree  he sends foragers in search of game. [4] 
 Thoren recognizes the advantageous position of the  Fist of the First Men , and Jeor restricts Thoren's rangers to patrolling the eastern bank of the  Milkwater . [8]  During a meeting of the officers, Thoren argues that the Night's Watch should advance into the  Frostfangs  and battle  Mance Rayder 's host of  wildlings . Lord Commander Mormont decides to send small scouting groups into the mountains to seek out the wildling camp, however. [9]  Thoren's name comes up by  Qhorin Halfhand  as a possible leader for one of the scouting groups. [9] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
 Thoren leads one of the search parties looking for the wildling host, finding them along the Milkwater in the Frostfangs. His scouts include  Kedge Whiteye  and  Bannen . [5]  After returning to the Fist, Thoren convinces Ser  Mallador Locke  and Jeor Mormont that the Night's Watch should surprise Mance's host. [5] 
 Before the Night's Watch departs the Fist, however, they are attacked by  wights . During the  fight at the Fist , Thoren coordinate the firing of fire arrows against the undead. As the Night's Watch is being defeated, Thoren advocates sending the reserve to hold the west wall of the Fist, but Lord Commander Mormont has him call them back to cut their way out. When a dead bear comes upon the commanders of the Night's Watch, Thoren charges the animal. He nearly takes the bear's head off with his longsword, but the beast then takes Thoren's own head from his shoulders. [3] 
 As the Night's Watch retreats to  Craster's Keep ,  Ronnel Harclay  replaces Thoren as commander of the remaining rangers. [10]  After Jeor Mormont's death in the  mutiny at Craster's Keep ,  Jon Snow  briefly contemplates Thoren succeeding as Lord Commander, but Jon remembers that Thoren is dead. [11] 
 
 Quotes by Thoren 
 Thoren : Send two hundred wolves against ten thousand sheep, ser, and see what happens. 
 Jarman : There are goats among these sheep, Thoren. Aye, and maybe a few lions.  Rattleshirt ,  Harma the Dogshead ,  Alfyn Crowkiller  ... 
 
 Thoren : I know them as well as you do, Buckwell. And I mean to have their heads, every one. These are  wildlings . No soldiers. A few hundred heroes, drunk most like, amidst a great horde of women, children, and thralls. We will sweep over them and send them howling back to their hovels. [9] 
  - Thoren and  Jarman Buckwell 
 
 
 This  King-beyond-the-Wall  will never look for us so far north. And this great host of his is a shambling horde, full of useless mouths who won't know what end of a sword to hold. One blow will take all the fight out of them and send them howling back to their hovels for another fifty years. [5] 
  - Thoren to  Mallador Locke 
 
 
 Ottyn : We are  the shield  that guards the realms of men. You do not throw away your shield for no good purpose. 
 Thoren : In a swordfight, a man's surest defense is the swift stroke that slays his foe, not cringing behind a shield. [5] 
  -  Ottyn Wythers  and Thoren
 Quotes about Thoren 
 Only fools like Thoren Smallwood despise the  wildlings . They are as brave as we are, Jon. [6] 
  -  Qhorin Halfhand  to  Jon Snow
