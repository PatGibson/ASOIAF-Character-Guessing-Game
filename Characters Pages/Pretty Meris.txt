 Despite being known as Pretty Meris, there is nothing pretty about her inside or out. [1]  She is near six feet tall and has blond hair. [2]  She is earless, with a slit nose and scars crossing both her cheeks. [2]  She is said to have cold dead eyes, [1]  like two grey stones. [3]  Meris dresses all in mail. There is talk that underneath her shirt only scars are left by the men who cut off her breasts. [3] 
 
 History 
 Originally from  Westeros , Meris has been with the  free companies  for twenty years. [1]  She was reportedly raped by half the members of her sellsword company. [1]  Meris eventually joined the  Windblown , and serves as the company's torturer. Old  Bill Bone  says that Meris can stretch out a man's dying for a  moon 's turn. [3] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Meris is part of the  Siege of Astapor . The  Tattered Prince  sends her along with several dozen Westerosi members of the company to secretly go over to  Daenerys Targaryen  as the Tattered Prince did not have much faith in the  Yunkai  commanders and wanted to ensure the  Windblown  would be on the winning side. [1]  However, Meris is arrested with the other Windblown when  Quentyn Martell  reveals to Daenerys the intentions of the Tattered Prince.
 Daenerys eventually orders that Meris be released as a gesture of her regard and brought back to the Tattered Prince, [2]  stating to Ser  Barristan Selmy  that if the Tattered Prince is a clever man he will understand her gesture.
 The Tattered Prince apparently confided in Meris that he wanted to betray Yunkai from the beginning, and decides join Daenerys in the hopes she would grant him  Pentos . [4]  Meris is present when the Tattered Prince later meets with  Quentyn Martell  and his two companions,  Gerris Drinkwater  and  Archibald Yronwood , at the  Purple Lotus . [3] 
 Quentyn hires the Windblown to try and capture one of Daenerys's  dragons , but Meris and the rest of the men flee when they see how dangerous  Viserion  and  Rhaegal  are and that they cannot be reliably controlled. [5]
