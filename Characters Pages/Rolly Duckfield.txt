History  Rolly was born in the Reach . His father was a blacksmith at Bitterbridge in service to old Lord Caswell . Rolly's strength and skill with a blade earned him a place in the castle garrison, but Rolly had dreams of knighthood . He resented seeing Lord Caswell's weakling son Lorent become a page, a squire, then a knight. Lord Caswell had only one son so no one in the castle was allowed to say a word against Lorent. In the yard the other squires barely touched him. On his sixteenth name day, Rolly's father made a longsword for Rolly as a present, but Lorent Caswell saw it and claimed it for his own, saying to Rolly that he was fit to wield a hammer not a sword. This caused Rolly to fetch a hammer and break both Lorent's arms and many of his ribs. Rolly then fled across the narrow sea to escape Lord Caswell's wrath. He joined the Golden Company as an apprentice smith and then served Ser Harry Strickland as a squire. [1]  When Griff needed someone to train his son Young Griff in skill at arms, Harry Strickland sent him Rolly. A year later Rolly was knighted by Griff. Having no second name Rolly choose the name Duckfield because he was in a field with some ducks when he was knighted, earning him the nickname "Duck".
