[2] [3] He is a simpleton, though Sansa Stark and Dontos Hollard suspect him of not being as simple as he seems. [2] [4]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones  He performs during the royal feast during the Tourney of the Hand , making witticisms about the various nobles in attendance and walking on stilts. Sansa wonders if he truly is the simpleton he claims to be, his song about the High Septon (the fat one) even makes Septa Mordane laugh. [2]   A Clash of Kings  When Dontos Hollard is made a fool he claims to Sansa Stark that Moon Boy is in the employment of Varys . Dontos claims to hear all sorts of things as a fool he never heard when he was a knight and claims Moon Boy is not as simple as he appears. [4]   A Storm of Swords  He performs at King Joffrey's wedding to Margaery Tyrell . [5]  After Jaime Lannister confesses to his younger brother Tyrion that Tysha was never in fact a whore, Tyrion becomes furious and reveals to Jaime some of the men he knows Cersei Lannister has been having sex with. To the confirmed list he sarcastically adds "... and Moon Boy for all I know." This obvious exaggeration has a strong effect on Jaime going forward. The words continue to haunt him during his subsequent missions through the Riverlands .  A Feast for Crows  At Darry , Jaime Lannister confronts his counsin Lancel about Cersei. Lancel admits that he had sex with her, and Jaime wonders how many more men his sister has slept with. He then wonders if Tyrion's comment about Moon Boy was just a gibe. Jaime later has a dream where he found his sister having sex with Moon Boy, after which he kills the fool and smashes Cersei’s teeth to splinters. When King Tommen Baratheon is permitted to name the last five of Cersei's dromonds , he chooses Moon Boy for one - but is dissuaded by the master of ships, Lord Aurane Waters . Moon Boy is present when Cersei Lannister hears that the Faith of the Seven have arrested Margaery Tyrell . He appears dumbstruck. [6]   Quotes about Moon Boy  The Spider pays in gold for any little trifle. I think Moon Boy had been his for years. [4]  – Dontos Hollard , to Sansa Stark    Cersei is a lying whore, she's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know. [7]   – Tyrion to Jaime   A fool he may be, but he wears his folly honestly. [6]  – Cersei Lannister 's thoughts   Was the part about Moon Boy just a gibe?  - Jaime Lannister 's thoughts while confronting Lancel Lannister  References    ↑   A Dance with Dragons , Appendix .   ↑ 2.0  2.1  2.2   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 29 , Sansa II.   ↑   A Clash of Kings , Chapter 65 , Sansa VIII.   ↑ 4.0  4.1  4.2   A Clash of Kings , Chapter 52 , Sansa IV.   ↑   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 59 , Sansa IV.   ↑ 6.0  6.1   A Feast for Crows , Chapter 43 , Cersei X.   ↑   A Feast for Crows , Chapter 8 , Jaime I.
