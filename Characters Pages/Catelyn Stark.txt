 History 
 Early Life 
   Catelyn by Paolo Puggioni © 
 Catelyn is the eldest daughter of Lord  Hoster Tully , the Lord of  Riverrun , head of  House Tully  and  Lord Paramount of the Trident , and his wife, Lady  Minisa Whent . She was annointed with the seven oils and named in the sept of Riverrun. [34]  Catelyn had two older brothers, who both died in infancy, causing her father to regard her as his heir until the birth of Catelyn's younger brother,  Edmure . [29]  Catelyn also has a sister,  Lysa , who is two years younger than her. [10] 
 Catelyn was raised at  Riverrun . She was close with her sister Lysa, [36]  and would play with her two younger siblings, as well as with her father's young ward,  Petyr Baelish . [33] [37]  Just as her younger siblings and Petyr were wont to do, Catelyn would go to her uncle, Ser  Brynden Tully , with her tears and tales, whenever Lord Hoster was too busy, and Lady Minisa was too ill. [10]  When Catelyn's mother died in childbirth, along with her son, Lord Hoster told his daughter that she had to be the Lady of Riverrun in her mother's stead. [29]  Catelyn does not have many memories of her mother, [23]  though she still remembers her warm smile and soft hands. [6]  Her relationship with her father was a close one, and according to Catelyn, Lord Hoster cherished her best of all his children. [29]  Whenever Hoster would ride off to court or a battle, he would tell Catelyn to watch for him from the battlements of Riverrun, which she did. [17]  And when his eyes tired, Hoster would have Catelyn read to him in his solar. [20] 
 Catelyn and Lysa played together as girls, and even had a secret language. [33]  Once, they made mud pies and served them to Petyr, who ate them and as a consequence was sick for a week. [27]  Catelyn and Lysa also practised kissing with Petyr in the  godswood  of  Riverrun , where Petyr attempted to stick his tongue in their mouths - an attempt which Catelyn halted, but Lysa both allowed and enjoyed. [11]  Catelyn often accompanied her father on his travels, and had visited the  inn at the crossroads  on multiple occasions. [27] [38]  Once, Catelyn, Lysa and Petyr accompanied Hoster to  Seagard . During the journey to the seat of  House Mallister , they stopped at  Oldstones , where Catelyn had played at being  Jenny of Oldstones , while Petyr had pretended to be her  Prince of Dragonflies . [38]  On their way back from Seagard to Riverrun, Catelyn and Lysa got lost in the mist, and were eventually found by Petyr Baelish. [12] 
 
 Betrothal to Brandon Stark 
 When Catelyn, at the age of twelve, was betrothed to  Brandon Stark , the heir to  Winterfell , she thanked her father for making such a splendid match for her. [29]  Lord  Hoster Tully 's ward,  Petyr Baelish , was less pleased with the match, however. While Catelyn had come to regard Petyr as a brother, [1] [12]  Petyr had fallen in love with Catelyn. [16]  When Catelyn's betrothal to Brandon was announced, [39]  Lords  Blackwood  and  Bracken  were at Riverrun to settle a feud with Hoster's help. Catelyn and Petyr danced six dances that night, but when he tried to kiss her, she pushed him away and laughed at him. Petyr, wounded by the rejection, became drunk and had to be brought to bed by Catelyn's uncle, Ser  Brynden Tully . Catelyn's younger sister, Lysa, who had fallen in love with Petyr, snuck into Petyr's chambers and had sex with him that night. However, the drunken Petyr believed he was having sex with Catelyn, and he called Lysa "Cat" before falling asleep again. [39] [40] 
 When the date of Catelyn's wedding was announced [39]  in  282 AC , [41]  Petyr challenged Brandon to a duel for her hand. [1]  Catelyn refused to give Petyr her favor when he asked, giving it to Brandon instead. [29] [40]  She begged Brandon not to kill Petyr, and he agreed. Petyr was severely injured during the duel, and the final cut Brandon gave him was so brutal that Catelyn was convinced the younger boy would die from it. [42]  Petyr did not die, however, but was given a fortnight to recover at Riverrun before being sent away. [29] [42]  Catelyn did not go see him during this time, nor did she say her farewells to him when he left Riverrun. [29]  After the duel, Brandon left Riverrun as well, promising her to return soon for their wedding. [17] 
 Later, on his way return to Riverrun, Brandon learned about the disappearance of his sister,  Lyanna Stark , and the involvement of Prince  Rhaegar Targaryen . Furious, he rode to  King's Landing , where he was arrested by King  Aerys II Targaryen . When Brandon's father, Lord  Rickard Stark , went to King's Landing to champion Brandon in his  trial by battle , both men were executed. [12] [43]  Shortly thereafter,  Robert's Rebellion  began. After Brandon had died, Petyr sent Catelyn a letter, which she burned without reading it. By then, her father had promised her hand to Brandon's younger brother,  Eddard , now the Lord of  Winterfell . [1] 
 
 Marriage to Eddard Stark 
   Catelyn and her daughters,  Arya  (left) and  Sansa  (right), by Mathia Arkoniel © 
 Catelyn married  Eddard Stark  after the rebels won the  Battle of the Bells , without ever having seen him before their wedding day. She married Eddard in the same ceremony as her sister Lysa married the elder Lord  Jon Arryn . Eddard and Jon played key roles in the rebellion, and a fortnight after the wedding both men rode off to war again. Catelyn remained at Riverrun, spending the first year of her marriage separated from her husband. [33] [44]  However, Catelyn had conceived a child during their wedding night, and she gave birth to  Robb  in  283 AC  at Riverrun, nine months after her wedding, [17] [38]  with the assistance of Maester  Luwin . [33] 
 After the war had ended, Catelyn and young Robb travelled to  Winterfell , where she was displeased to discover that Eddard's  bastard  son,  Jon Snow , had already been set up in the castle. [33]  While Catelyn had always been aware that men fathered bastards, and had not been surprised to learn of Jon's existence, Jon arriving at Winterfell before Catelyn and Robb had hurt her feelings. Eddard's insistence on raising the boy at Winterfell and his refusal to identify the boy's mother caused frictions between them, leaving Catelyn jealous and angry. [5]  Catelyn concluded that Eddard must have loved Jon's mother deeply, and she heard rumors at Winterfell about  Ashara Dayne  from  Dorne . However, when she finally had gathered enough courage to ask her husband about the Dornishwoman, Eddard demanded to learn where the rumor had come from. Ashara's name was never mentioned in Winterfell again, and Catelyn remembers the night as "the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her". [33]  Catelyn has never trusted Jon, [20]  fearing that the bastard's children might contest her grandchildren's inheritance. [33] [38]  Because of her, Jon has always felt like an outsider. [45] 
 On Eddard's part, the knowledge that Catelyn had actually been his brother Brandon's bride created a rift in their marriage. Despite these issues, however, Catelyn and Eddard grew to deeply love each other over the years. [33]  They had four more children— Sansa  (b.  286 AC ),  Arya  (b.  289 AC ),  Bran  (b.  290 AC ), and  Rickon  (b.  295 AC ) [46] —all delivered by Luwin. [33] 
 As the Lady of Winterfell, Catelyn became familiar with the lords of the  north , and she once comforted a fellow  southron , Lady  Lynesse Hightower , by telling her how she had once felt out of place in the north, but had come to love it all the same. [38]  Eddard had a  sept  built at Winterfell for Catelyn, so she could pray to  her own gods . [34]

 A Game of Thrones 
   Catelyn and Eddard at the Godswood - by Denmark © 
 After the arrival of the  royal  party at  Winterfell , Catelyn receives a letter from her sister  Lysa , stating that the  Lannisters  had killed her husband, Lord  Jon Arryn , the late  Hand of the King . This puts the Starks on guard, as Eddard has just been offered the position of Hand by his friend, King  Robert I Baratheon . Catelyn pushes Ned to accept the offer along with a betrothal that would make  Sansa  queen one day. Despite misgivings about going to  King's Landing , Ned accepts. [33] 
 When  Bran  is left in a coma having apparently fallen while climbing the  First Keep , Catelyn stays by his side for eight days, ignoring her own affairs and those of Winterfell. On the eighth night, she is attacked by an  assassin  who had come for Bran. During the ensuing struggle she grabs the blade of his knife, causing deep lacerations to her palms, before  Bran's direwolf  attacks and kills him. [15]  After recovering, Catelyn travels to King's Landing along with Ser  Rodrik Cassel  to inform Eddard, sailing on the  Storm Dancer . Despite having travelled in secret they are met by guards upon their arrival, and are taken to a brothel owned by Lord  Petyr Baelish , Catelyn's childhood friend, who tells her that the  Valyrian steel dagger  used in the attack belonged to  Tyrion Lannister . [1] 
 On their way back to Winterfell, still travelling in secret, they encounter Tyrion at the  inn at the crossroads . He recognizes her, exposing her identity to those present, which includes men-at-arms in service to bannermen of  House Tully . Catelyn successfully appeals to them to detain Tyrion for conspiring to murder her son, and assist her in returning him to Winterfell to await justice. [27]  Despite Catelyn announcing her intention to take him to Winterfell, their party instead makes its way to the  Eyrie  for trial. During the journey they come under attack by  clansmen  on the  high road  in the  Mountains of the Moon . Tyrion successfully persuades Catelyn to allow her captives to take up arms, and goes on to save her during the skirmish. [10]  At the Eyrie, Tyrion is thrown into a  sky cell , but escapes execution by convincing  a sellsword  to fight in a  trial by combat . [42]  Meanwhile, the arrest had become a  catalyst  for the  war  that followed, as  Tywin Lannister  orders Ser  Gregor Clegane  and other raiders to attack the riverlands in retribution. [47] 
 Her son Robb having marched south with his father's bannermen in response to Eddard's arrest in King's Landing, Catelyn joins  House Manderly 's levies at  White Harbor  and meets the northern host in the field at  Moat Cailin . [48]  She is accompanied by her uncle, Ser  Brynden Tully , who had left his  service  to  House Arryn , disgusted by Lysa's refusal to help against the Lannisters. [42]  When Robb is about to place Lord  Greatjon Umber  in command of the infantry force sent to engage  Tywin Lannister , Catelyn is able to convince him to appoint Lord  Roose Bolton , a man of cold calculation. [48]  Robb wants Catelyn to return to the north, but she stays with the army in order to see her dying father, Lord  Hoster Tully . [48] 
 When the army finds it necessary to cross the  Green Fork , the delicate task of negotiating with Lord  Walder Frey  falls to Catelyn. She negotiates passage and an alliance with  House Frey  by promising, among other things, Robb's hand in marriage to one of Walder's daughter and  Arya's  hand to Walder's son  Elmar . [8]  Cat is present for Robb's victory at the  battle in the Whispering Wood , where her guard is commanded by  Hallis Mollen . [17] 
 After the news of Eddard's execution by order of King  Joffrey I Baratheon , Catelyn is filled with grief but maintains composure for the sake of her son. During the war council at Riverrun after the  Battle of the Camps , Catelyn argues for peace with the south so that Sansa and Arya might be more easily brought to safety. Robb and the assembled lords make clear their desire to continue the war, with the Greatjon declaring Robb the first  King in the North  in three centuries. [11] 
 
 A Clash of Kings 
 Catelyn advises against Robb's plan to send Eddard's ward,  Theon Greyjoy , on a diplomatic mission to offer terms of an alliance with his father, Lord  Balon Greyjoy , as she does not trust either. [23]  With Robb south of the  Neck ,  House Greyjoy  ends up invading the north and Balon declares himself  King of the Isles and the North . [49] 
 It is Catelyn's idea to attempt to ally with  Renly Baratheon , who has a massive host, but she wishes to remain with Robb. [23]  When he threatens to send the boisterous Greatjon as his envoy, Catelyn relents and goes herself, accepting the fact that her son was becoming a man. She travels south to  Bitterbridge  to meet King Renly's host, where she finds him hosting a  great melee . [28]  When news arrives that Renly's brother  Stannis  is laying  siege to Storm's End , the seat of  House Baratheon , Catelyn rides with Renly and part of his host. [50] 
 Catelyn is present for the inconclusive parley between the two brothers outside  Storm's End , [50]  and she witnesses Renly's murder later that night by a mysterious  creature of shadow .  Brienne of Tarth , one of Renly's  Rainbow Guard , is the only other person present, so the pair flee in the knowledge that they would be blamed for the murder. They journey to Riverrun, and on the way Catelyn takes Brienne into her service. [6] 
 Catelyn disapproves of the admittance of  smallfolk  into Riverrun by her brother, Ser  Edmure Tully . [24]  When  silent sisters  bring the bones of  Eddard Stark  to Riverrun, Catelyn tasks  Hallis Mollen  with returning them to Winterfell. [24]  She and Brienne remain within the castle during the  Battle of the Fords . [29] 
 Upon hearing of her two youngest sons' supposed murders at the hand of Theon following his  capture of Winterfell , Catelyn meets with the imprisoned Ser  Jaime Lannister . The Kingslayer admits to having thrown Bran from the  First Keep  but insists he did not send the  catspaw  to attack the comatose boy. [12] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
   Catelyn claws her face and screams after the death of  Robb Stark  at the  Red Wedding  - by nejna © 
 Catelyn frees Jaime in a covert attempt to exchange him for her daughters  Sansa  and  Arya , believed to be captives at King's Landing. [30]  Cat sends Brienne as Jaime's escort and Ser  Cleos Frey  as an envoy. [30] [44] 
 Catelyn is placed under house arrest at Riverrun by Ser  Desmond Grell  and by Edmure once her brother returns from battle. [44]  After returning from the  westerlands , Robb's bannermen are cool toward Catelyn because of her release of Jaime, and Lord  Rickard Karstark  is especially outraged at having been denied vengeance for Jaime having slain two of his sons,  Eddard  and  Torrhen . [18]  Robb forgives his mother after he tells her of his wedding to  Jeyne Westerling  after the  storming of the Crag . [18]  Rickard later murders two of Robb's prisoners,  Willem Lannister  and  Tion Frey , leading to his own beheading by the  King in the North . [51] 
 Catelyn's father, Lord Hoster, finally dies at Riverrun, making Edmure the new lord. [52]  Cat advises Robb to make peace with the Lannisters, but the king declines. [52] 
 While traveling to the  Twins  for Edmure's marriage with  Roslin Frey , Catelyn objects to Robb's intention to name  Jon Snow  his heir. [38]  Against her wishes, Robb intends to have Catelyn remain at  Seagard  under the protection of Lord  Jason Mallister  for the remainder of the war. [38] 
 Catelyn attends Edmure's wedding at the Twins, sitting between Ser  Ryman Frey  and Lord  Roose Bolton  during the feast. [21]  However, the  Freys  and  Boltons  betray the Starks in an act of treachery that becomes known as the  Red Wedding . In a desperate attempt to save her son's life, Catelyn seizes Lord  Walder Frey 's lackwit grandson,  Aegon , and tries to trade his life for Robb's. When Robb is killed by Roose, Catelyn saws through Aegon's throat with a knife. Walder had planned to take Catelyn hostage, [53]  but the maddened woman claws her own face and Ser  Raymund Frey  is allowed to slit her throat. [21]  The Freys dump her body naked into the Green Fork, a mockery of  House Tully 's funeral customs, [54]  after Catelyn has been dead for a day and a night. [55] 
 Three days after her death, [3]  Catelyn's corpse is retrieved from the Green Fork by  Arya Stark 's  direwolf ,  Nymeria , who runs away when humans approach. [56]  Catelyn is resurrected by Lord  Beric Dondarrion , who gives his life for hers through the  last kiss . Catelyn's wounds only partially heal, however, leaving her mutilated and without the ability to speak. Consumed with the desire for vengeance over her family's betrayal and murder, she assumes command of Beric's outlaw band, the  brotherhood without banners , and leads them in mercilessly pursuing and executing everyone she considers a Lannister collaborator, among them  Petyr  and  Merrett Frey  at  Oldstones . [55] 
 
 A Feast for Crows 
   Lady Stoneheart, with Robb's crown - by zippo514 © 
 A cloaked and hooded woman is spoken of in the vicinity of  Fairmarket [3]  and  Hag's Mire . [57]  There are also tales of a woman called  Stoneheart  leading a band of outlaws different from Beric's brotherhood. According to one story, she was hanged by Freys but revived by Beric, and now the two lovers cannot die. [2]  The mysterious woman is also known as the Silent Sister, Mother Merciless and the Hangwoman. [3] 
 While leading the brotherhood, Stoneheart's outlaws come upon a small party led by  Brienne of Tarth , who insists she is searching for Sansa at the behest of  Jaime Lannister . Thoros reveals to Brienne that Beric's brotherhood has been broken. Using a  young northman  as her interpreter, Stoneheart says that Brienne has turned traitor, as she carries  Oathkeeper , a Lannister sword forged from the Stark  Valyrian steel  blade,  Ice . Brienne swears she is still faithful but Stoneheart insists she must prove it by killing Jaime. Brienne refuses, stating that Jaime has changed. Stoneheart says she must choose, either kill Jaime or be hanged. Brienne refuses to choose. Just before she,  Hyle Hunt  and  Podrick Payne  are to be executed, however, Brienne shouts out a word. [3] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 After  Theon Greyjoy  returns to  Winterfell  for the wedding of  Ramsay Bolton  and " Arya Stark ", [58]  Catelyn's ruined sept is among the places he visits. [59]  Within the  castle crypts , Lady  Barbrey Dustin  recollects to Theon that her one-time lover,  Brandon Stark , had not wanted to wed Catelyn. Barbrey had also hoped to wed  Eddard Stark  after Brandon died, but Ned instead married Catelyn during  Robert's Rebellion . Barbrey intends to prevent  Hallis Mollen  from returning Ned's bones to Winterfell. [60] 
 
 Lady Stoneheart 
 See also:  Images of Lady Stoneheart 
 Death has changed Catelyn. Stoneheart is less gracious and forgiving than in life and is consumed with a desire for vengeance on anyone she thinks betrayed her and her son, Robb. She hangs any men associated with the Freys, Boltons, or Lannisters, even if they had nothing to do with the "Red Wedding" or if they are boys, as is the case of  Podrick Payne . Her appearance has been altered as well, with her flesh becoming soft and the color of curdled milk due to her corpse being submerged in river water for days. Half of her hair is gone and the rest is white and brittle. In addition, her wounds have not healed with her face covered in scratch marks and her throat still slit open. To speak she must cover the wound on her throat; even then she is difficult to understand. [55] [3] 
 
 Quotes by Catelyn 
   Catelyn as portrayed by Michelle Fairley in  Game of Thrones 
 My son  lies here broken and dying, Luwin, and you wish to discuss a new master of  horse ? Do you think I care what happens in the stables? Do you think it matters to me one whit? I would gladly butcher every horse in  Winterfell  with my own hands if it would open Bran's eyes, do you understand that?  Do you? [15] —Catelyn, to  Maester   Luwin 
 
 Catelyn : A woman can rule as wisely as a man. 
 Brynden : The right woman can. Make no mistake, Cat.  Lysa  is not you. [10] —Catelyn and  Brynden Tully 
 
 Robb, if that sword could bring him back, I should never let you sheathe it until  Ned  stood at my side once more... but he is gone, and a hundred  Whispering Woods  will not change that. [11] —Catelyn, to  Robb Stark 
 
 If I must trade our four  Lannisters  for their two  Starks , I will call that a bargain and thank the gods. I want you safe, Robb, ruling at  Winterfell  from  your father 's seat. I want you to live your life, to kiss a girl and wed a woman and father a son. I want to write an end to this. I want to go home, my lords, and weep for my husband. [11] —Catelyn, to  Robb Stark  and his council 
 
 I want to weep, she thought. I want to be comforted. I'm so tired of being strong. I want to be foolish and frightened for once. Just for a small while, that's all ... a day ... an hour. [28] —Catelyn's thoughts 
 
 It is a monstrous cruel thing to lose a child. [44] —Catelyn to herself

 Quotes about Catelyn 
 All his life Tyrion had prided himself on his cunning, the only gift the gods had seen fit to give him, yet this seven-times-damned she-wolf Catelyn Stark had outwitted him at every turn. The knowledge was more galling than the bare fact of his abduction. [31] — Tyrion Lannister 's thoughts 
 
 Catelyn Stark might take a man prisoner, but she'd never stoop to rob him. That wouldn't be honorable. [25] — Tyrion Lannister  to  Mord

 Quotes about Lady Stoneheart 
 She don't speak. You bloody bastards cut her throat too deep for that. But she remembers. [55] — Lem , to  Merrett Frey 
 
 Her cloak and collar hid the gash  his brother ’s blade had made, but her face was even worse than he remembered. The flesh had gone pudding soft in the water and turned the color of curdled milk. Half her hair was gone and the rest had turned as white and brittle as a crone’s. Beneath her ravaged scalp, her face was shredded skin and black blood where she had raked herself with her nails. But her eyes were the most terrible thing. Her eyes saw him, and they hated. [55] — Merrett Frey 's thoughts 
 
 And there's this other band, led by this woman Stoneheart... Lord  Beric's  lover, according to one tale. Supposedly she was hanged by the Freys, but Dondarrion kissed her and brought her back to life, and now she cannot die, no more than he. [2] — Hyle Hunt  to  Brienne of Tarth 
 
 The  Freys  slashed her throat from ear to ear. When we found her by the river she was three days dead.  Harwin  begged me to give her the  kiss of life , but it had been too long. I would not do it, so Lord  Beric  put his lips to hers instead, and the flame of life passed from him to her. And... she rose. May the  Lord of Light  protect us. She  rose . [3] — Thoros  to  Brienne of Tarth
