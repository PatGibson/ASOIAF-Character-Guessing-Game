 Recent Events 
 A Game of Thrones 
 Beric comes to  King's Landing  to fight in the  Hand's tourney  celebrating  Eddard Stark 's appointment as  Hand of the King . [11]   Jeyne Poole  wishes to marry him as soon as she sees him. [12]  During the tournament, Beric loses a horse in a tilt with a  hedge knight  and is unhorsed by  Thoros of Myr  shortly thereafter. [12]  After the conclusion of the tournament, Beric remains in King's Landing. This leads to Eddard appointing him leader of an expedition to arrest Ser  Gregor Clegane , who has been raiding the  riverlands  after the capture of  Tyrion Lannister . [13] 
 Beric's party is ambushed in the  battle at the Mummer's Ford , however, with many killed. By the time that  Robb Stark  and his allies are fighting the  Lannister  armies near the  Trident , Beric's survivors continually raid the Lannisters' foraging parties. [1] [14] [15]  Lord Dondarrion is named among the nobles King  Joffrey I Baratheon  insists must do homage to him or be named traitors. [16] 
 
 A Clash of Kings 
 Rumors have Beric as missing or perhaps dead. [1] [17]  Ser  Burton Crakehall , [18]  Ser  Amory Lorch , [19]  and Ser  Gregor Clegane [19]  all claim to have killed him. Yet, he is still raiding the Lannister foraging parties [18]  and the  Mountain's men  are actively seeking him, [20]  as are Lord  Tywin Lannister 's forces stationed at  Harrenhal . [21] 
 Beric's group meets  smallfolk  plagued by the ravage of Lannister forces but does not trouble them, and he attempts to pay for the food they take. [21]  The outlaws slay Burton's column of  westermen  in a trap. [18] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
   Beric Dondarrion vs  Sandor Clegane  - by Amok © 
 Arya Stark ,  Gendry , and  Sandor Clegane  are captured by members of the  brotherhood without banners , who plan to bring them to Beric. [22] [23]  Meanwhile, Beric travels throughout the riverlands, including a visit to  Acorn Hall . [9]  Some of his men disguise themselves as the lightning lord to suggest he can be everywhere. [9] 
 The captives are brought to Beric within the  hollow hill , where he sits on  weirwood  roots and is revealed as a follower of the  Lord of Light . They watch as  Sandor Clegane  duels Beric in a  trial by battle . While  Thoros of Myr  always lit his blades with  wildfire , Beric uses his own blood to make his sword magically aflame. Despite Sandor's fear of fire, he is able to slay Beric. Much to their surprise, however, Beric is revived by Thoros. [4] 
 It is revealed that Beric had been mortally wounded by Ser  Gregor Clegane 's lance at the  Mummer's Ford , but his squire  Edric Dayne  and  Green Gergen  protected him and helped him to escape. Despite the efforts of Thoros, Beric died in an ash grove that night. Beric was unexpectedly resurrected when Thoros performed the  last kiss  of the  Lord of Light , however. [6]  He became the leader of an outlaw band protecting smallfolk in the name of the late King  Robert I Baratheon . Beric was killed several more times, but was repeatedly brought back to life by Thoros. [4] [6] 
 The weary Beric has become a scarecrow of a man, his battered body bearing all the wounds of his previous deaths. [4]  His memory is impaired, having forgotten details about  his castle  and  the woman  he was pledged to marry. [6]  The lord still wears his ragged black cloak and dented breastplate. Arya thinks Beric does not eat or sleep. Beric swears he will return the girl to her mother,  Catelyn Stark . [6] 
 Beric is aided by Edric during the  battle at the burning septry  against the  Bloody Mummers , after which he  knights  Gendry. [6]  Beric later visits the  ghost of High Heart  to hear her wisdom. Because Beric wants to ransom Arya to her family, the girl runs away from the brotherhood. [5] 
 Merrett Frey  goes to  Oldstones  to ransom  Petyr Frey  from the brotherhood, but  Tom Sevenstrings  tells him that Beric is elsewhere.  A woman  grants approval for the outlaws to hang Merrett. [24] 
 
 A Feast for Crows 
   Lord Beric - by Christopher Ocampo © 
 Ser  Kevan Lannister  informs Queen  Cersei Lannister  that Beric has been hanging  Freys . [25]   Mariya Darry ,  Amerei Frey , and Ser  Daven Lannister  believe the river lords and smallfolk are helping Beric. [10] [26]  In order to turn the smallfolk against the brotherhood, Lord  Randyll Tarly  spreads rumors that the  Hound  joined Beric's outlaws. [27]  Ser  Harwyn Plumm  promises Amerei that he will kill Beric. [10]  The mysterious  Stoneheart  is rumored to be Beric's lover. [27] 
 Thoros reveals to Brienne that Beric truly died when he gave his life to bring back Catelyn Stark, whose body had been found by the outlaws after the  Red Wedding . Thoros refused to revive Catelyn, so Beric passed the flame of life from him to her. The brotherhood has fractured with Catelyn, now called Lady Stoneheart, as their leader, with some leaving the outlaw band. [28] [29] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Ser  Jaime Lannister  is prepared to fight Beric and his outlaws, not realizing the lightning lord has died for the final time. [30]

 Quotes by Beric 
   Richard Dormer as Beric in  Game of Thrones 
 Guardsman : Here to fight in the  Hand's tourney , my lord? Beric : Here to  win  the Hand's tourney. [11] —Beric arriving in  King's Landing 
 
 
 
 Six score of us set out to bring the king's justice to  your brother . Six score brave men and true, led by a fool in a starry cloak. [4] —Beric to  Sandor Clegane 
 
 
 
 Even  brave men  blind themselves sometimes, when they are afraid to see. [6] —Beric to  Arya Stark 
 
 
 
 Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held  a castle  on  the Marches  once, and there was  a woman  I was pledged to marry, but I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that woman's hair. Who  knighted  me, old friend? What were my favorite foods? It all fades. Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that  grove of ash , with the  taste of fire  in my mouth and a hole in my chest. Are you my mother, Thoros? [6] —Beric to  Thoros of Myr 
 
 
 
 Beric : Gendry, do you swear before the eyes of gods and men to defend those who cannot defend themselves, to protect all women and children, to obey your captains, your liege lord, and your king, to fight bravely when needed and to such other tasks as are laid upon you, however hard or humble or dangerous they may be? 
 Gendry : I do, m'lord. 
 
 Beric : Arise Ser Gendry, knight of the  hollow hill , and be welcome to our  brotherhood . [6] —Beric and  Gendry 
 
 
 
 Beric : Fire consumes. It  consumes , and when it is done there is nothing left.  Nothing . Thoros : Beric. Sweet friend. What are you saying? Beric : Nothing I have not said before.  Six times , Thoros? Six times is too many. [5] —Beric and  Thoros of Myr 
 
 Quotes about Beric 
 The lightning lord is everywhere and nowhere, skinny squirrel. [9] — Greenbeard  to  Arya Stark 
 
 
 
 They say Lord Beric always gives a man a trial, that he won't kill a man unless something's proved against him. [24] — Merrett Frey  to  Lem 
 
 
 
 Lyle : Once we're done at  Riverrun , I'll be itching for another fight. Not that Beric Dondarrion is like to give me one. I recall the man from tourneys past. A comely lad in a pretty cloak, he was. Slight and callow. Arwood : That was before he died. Death changed him, the  smallfolk  say. You can kill him, but he won't stay dead. How do you fight a man like that? [10] — Lyle Crakehall  and  Arwood Frey 
 
 
 
 Don't get me started on Lord Beric. He's here, he's there, he's everywhere, but when you send men after him, he melts away like dew. [26] — Daven Lannister  to  Jaime Lannister 
 
 
 
 Brienne : You ride with the Dondarrion. The lightning lord. Thoros : Lightning comes and goes and then is seen no more. So too with men. Lord Beric's fire has gone out of this world, I fear.  A grimmer shadow  leads us in his place. [28] — Brienne of Tarth  and  Thoros of Myr
