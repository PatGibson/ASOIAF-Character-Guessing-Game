[1] He is regarded as a good man, though weak willed.  Recent Events  A Clash of Kings  After the death of the previous High Septon during the riot of King's Landing , Tyrion Lannister selects his replacement. The new High Septon, while not corrupt like the previous one, is still considered a pawn.  A Storm of Swords  The High Septon attends a small council meeting after the Battle of the Blackwater . [2]  The High Septon prays with Lancel Lannister after the boy is badly wounded during the Battle of the Blackwater . Lancel confesses to bedding Cersei Lannister to His High Holiness and expresses his anger with her, but the High Septon says he must forgive her. [3]  Tyrion's appointee performs the marriage between Joffrey I and Margaery Tyrell at the Great Sept of Baelor and attends the wedding feast afterwards. [4]   A Feast for Crows  The High Septon greets Queen Cersei Lannister on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor before the wake for Tywin Lannister . [1]  The High Septon reportedly dies in his sleep. [5] Actually, Cersei, paranoid of what the High Septon might know and the fact that he was selected by her brother Tyrion , has Osney Kettleblack sneak into the High Septon's chamber while he sleeps and suffocate him with a pillow. [6] He is succeeded by the High Sparrow , who is imposed on the Most Devout by a group of sparrows . [7]  Having been tortured by the Faith to confirm his claims of sleeping with Queen Margaery Tyrell , Osney confesses to having slept with Cersei and having murdered the previous High Septon at her command. The High Sparrow then has Cersei arrested. [6]   Quotes  Our present High Septon is a trained seal who barks prettily on command.
