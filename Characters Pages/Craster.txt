 Appearance and Character 
 See also:  Images of Craster 
 Once a powerful-looking man, Craster is nearing the end of his life. His hair is grey turning to white. He has a flat nose and a drooping mouth, which gives him a cruel look. One of Craster's ears is missing, which he has lost to the cold. [2]  His teeth are brown and rotten. [1]  Craster wears a sheepskin jerkin and a cloak of sewn skins, as well as a twisted heavy gold ring about his wrist. [2] [1]  He drinks thin yellow  beer  from a chipped stone cup, but prefers  wine  from the  Seven Kingdoms . [2] 
 Craster is one of the few wildlings not openly hostile to the  Night's Watch . Although he shows the Watch no malice and offers sanctuary to those north of the  Wall  on  rangings , he is regarded as a tenuous ally at best. This is due to his incestuous relationships with  his daughter-wives  and suspicions of  kinslaying , sacrificing  his male children . [2]  Craster is not an ally of  Mance Rayder , [2]  and he dislikes  Rattleshirt . [3] 
 
 History 
 Craster is the  bastard  son of a man of the  Night's Watch  and a wildling woman from the village of  Whitetree . His father abandoned his mother after Craster was conceived, and when his mother tried to bring him to  Castle Black , she was chased off by members of the Watch. His father's name is never mentioned. [4] 
 Craster's Keep  is located in the  haunted forest , where he lives with  his nineteen wives , [2]  and he has other daughters too young to wed. [5]  Any sons he has are sacrificed to  cold gods . [2] 
 Jeor Mormont ,  Lord Commander of the Night's Watch , once gifted Craster with a crossbow. [2]  Craster  cut out the tongue  of an envoy sent by  Mance Rayder ,  King-Beyond-the-Wall . [2]   Gilly  drank sweet mead when she wed Craster in the summer. [6]

 Quotes by Craster 
 Jeor : These are bad times to dwell alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising. 
 Craster : Let them rise. My roots are sunk deep. [2] 
  -  Jeor Mormont  and Craster
 
 
 A godly man got no cause to fear such. I said as much to that  Mance Rayder  once, when he come sniffing round. He never listened, no more'n you crows with your swords and your bloody fires. That won't help you none when the white cold comes. Only  the gods  will help you then. You best get right with the gods. [1]

 Craster : Who calls me  bastard ?

 Quotes about Craster 
 Dolorous Edd  says Craster's a terrible savage. He marries  his daughters  and obeys no laws but those he makes himself. And  Dywen  told  Grenn  he's got black blood in his veins. His mother was a  wildling  woman who lay with a  ranger , so he's a  bas  ... [2] 
  -  Samwell Tarly  to  Jon Snow 
 
 
 The man's half-mad, I won't deny it, but you'd be the same if you'd spent your life in  this cursed wood . Even so, he's never turned a  ranger  away from his fire, nor does he love  Mance Rayder . He'll give us good counsel. [2] 
  -  Thoren Smallwood  to  Jeor Mormont 
 
 
 Jon : At  Winterfell  one of the serving women told us stories. She used to say that there were  wildlings  who would lay with the  Others  to birth half-human children. 
 Jeor : Hearth tales. Does Craster seem less than human to you? 
 
 Jon : He gives  his sons  to the wood. [2] 
  -  Jon Snow  and  Jeor Mormont 
 
 
 Craster's blood is black, and he bears a heavy curse. [4]
