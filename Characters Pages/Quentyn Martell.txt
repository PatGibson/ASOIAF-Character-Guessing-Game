[9] He has a high forehead, broad nose, and square jaw. [8] [9] He does not smile easily. [8] Quentyn is sensible and dutiful, [4] but solemn and not handsome. [9] [2]  Quentyn is cautious by nature [8] and filled with doubts, fears, and insecurities. [1] [8] [10] He does not want to be remembered as a failure, and cannot bear the thought of his father's disappointment, [3] [4] [8] nor does he want friends to die for nothing. [3]  Fostered at Yronwood , Quentyn came to see Cletus Yronwood , his dearest friend, as a brother in all but blood, [8] and Cletus's father, Lord Anders , as a second father. [3]  Quentyn speaks the Volantene [8] and Ghiscari tongues. [4] [10] While he can read and write High Valyrian , he has had little practice in speaking it. [8] A virgin, [10] Quentyn is uncomfortable around girls. [2] [8]   History  Quentyn was born the second child of Doran Martell , Prince of Dorne , and his wife, Lady Mellario of Norvos . [11] At a young age, Quentyn was sent to be fostered by Lord Anders Yronwood , whom he served as a page and later squire. [12] Quentyn was fostered at Yronwood to repair the relationship between House Martell and House Yronwood , which had been damaged by a duel between Quentyn’s uncle, Prince Oberyn Martell , and Lord Edgar Yronwood , more than a decade before. Edgar and Oberyn had both taken cuts during this duel, but while Oberyn recovered, Edgar's wounds festered and he eventually died. This led to whispers that Oberyn had fought with a poisoned blade, [13] so sending Quentyn to Yronwood was to settle this blood debt. [14] Mellario felt Quentyn was too young to be sent away, however, and the boy's fosterage was one of the strains on his parents' marriage. [14]  When Quentyn first arrived at Yronwood, he was smitten with Lord Anders's eldest daughter, Ynys . His crush lasted until the day she wed and left Yronwood. He received his first kiss from one of the Drinkwater twins , though Quentyn never knew which one. [8]  Once, when Quentyn had already been at Yronwood, Prince Doran wrote him a letter in which he instructed Quentyn to do all his maester and master-at-arms required of him, as Quentyn would one day rule Dorne , and he therefore needed to be strong of both mind and body. [12] While Quentyn's elder sister, Princess Arianne Martell , is Doran's heir by Dornish custom, the Prince of Dorne had negotiated a secret marriage pact by which Arianne is to wed the exiled Viserys Targaryen and Quentyn would instead become the successor to Dorne. [15]  At Yronwood, Quentyn befriended Anders's eldest son, Cletus , Cletus's cousin Archibald , Gerris Drinkwater , and Willam Wells . [8] Quentyn received his knighthood at the age of eighteen, [7] from Lord Anders Yronwood, after turning down the same offer made by his uncle, Prince Oberyn. [12]  Quentyn has been riding horses since he was six, [10] and has been trained with spear and sword and shield since he was old enough to walk. [1] Amongst the people in Dorne, Quentyn is little known. [14]   Recent Events  A Storm of Swords  Quentyn is among those Lord Tywin Lannister considers as a possible candidate in marriage for his daughter, the widowed Queen Cersei . [16]   A Feast for Crows  Quentyn is believed to be in the Boneway with the host of Lord Anders Yronwood . However, in truth, he has crossed the narrow sea in secret. [12] His sister, Princess Arianne Martell , erroneously believes Quentyn is recruiting mercenaries to displace her as heir of Dorne, with the approval of their father, Doran Martell . [12] [14]  After Arianne’s coup to crown Princess Myrcella Baratheon fails, [14] she is arrested and confined at Sunspear for several weeks. [15] When she confronts her father, she reveals that she is aware that Quentyn travelled across the narrow sea, and that Prince Doran had considered Quentyn his heir. Doran then tells Arianne the truth about a secret marriage pact , and reveals what Quentyn has been sent east for. [15]   A Dance with Dragons   Ser Gerris , Prince Quentyn, and Ser Archibald - by Sasha Gladysh ©   Rhaegal 's flame engulfs Quentyn - by Marc Fishman ©   The Dragontamer by Ashley Hunter Rice  In Dorne , Doran tells his daughter Arianne that he has heard how a great fleet, mostly Volantene ships, has set sail from Lys, and that there had been talk about elephants . Believing that it might be Daenerys, Doran states that, if Quentyn is with her, he will bring her up to the Greenblood if he can. [17] In truth, however, the Golden Company has set sail for the stormlands . [18] [19]  Quentyn has been sent across the narrow sea with Ser Cletus Yronwood , Ser Gerris Drinkwater , Ser Willam Wells , Ser Archibald Yronwood , and Maester Kedry to bring Daenerys Targaryen to Dorne . They left from the Planky Town in Dorne, where they boarded a ship. When in Lys , Quentyn reluctantly plays the role of a merchant. [8] They change ships in Lys , boarding the Meadowlark  . When the ship is boarded by corsairs, however, Cletus, Will, and Kedry are slain. [8]  Quentyn and his companions spend more time in Volantis than they had expected, due to the conflicts in Slaver's Bay , attempting to find a ship willing to bring them to Meereen . Gerris pretends to be a wine merchant looking for a ship to take him and his two "servants" to Meereen , but every captain they try to convince to take them on this journey refuses, and in the end they are forced to consider seeking passage on the smuggler's ship Adventure . [8] While the war between Astapor and Yunkai has not yet reached Meereen, no trade ships are leaving for the city as the fighting pits are closed and the slave trade has been banned. [8] [20]  Eventually, Quentyn and his two companions join the Windblown , a mercenary company hired by Yunkai, as a way to reach Daenerys. [1] [8] Quentyn is given the nickname "Frog" by the other sellswords, and he acts as the squire to Archibald, who is called "Greenguts". [18] Quentyn and his companions fight incognito during the siege of Astapor . Quentyn, Gerris and Archibald plan to desert once they are north of Yunkai, but the Tattered Prince orders them and other Westerosi from the company to defect to Daenerys's side. The Tattered Prince wants to make sure that, should the tide turn, he will be still on the winning side. [1] The feigned Windblown turncloaks are eventually found by the Stormcrows , and Daario Naharis brings them to Meereen, [21] where Quentyn dresses plainly. [2]  Daario brings the feigned turncloaks to Queen Daenerys in her audience chamber and presents them as recruits of his Stormcrows. Quentyn and his friends reveal that they are knights, but ask for privacy in order to reveal their names. After the court is cleared, Quentyn hands over his "gift", a parchment containing a secret pact , signed by Ser Willem Darry and Prince Oberyn Martell , with the Sealord of Braavos witnessing the signatures. The pact was for Viserys Targaryen to wed Quenty's sister, Arianne, in return for Dorne's support in helping the exile regain the Iron Throne . With Viserys having died at Vaes Dothrak , however, Quentyn now offers himself as a husband for Daenerys in return for the support of Dorne. Daario mocks Quentyn, angering his companions. Daenerys orders Quentyn and his friends to be treated courteously, and reveals her upcoming marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq . She gives the Dornishmen a room in the pyramid. [9] While Ser Barristan Selmy believes Quentyn's arrival changes everything, Daenerys disagrees, and she wonders about Quaithe 's prophecy and the "sun's son". [9]  Quentyn approaches Daenerys the next day, the day of her wedding, wondering if he has displeased her. Daenerys tells Quentyn that one day, she will come to Westeros and look to Dorne for help. [9] Quentyn reveals to Daenerys and her court that the other Windblown who had joined the Stormcrows had done so under false pretenses, and the feigned turncloaks are arrested. [2]  Quentyn and his companions are present at the feast held to celebrate the signing of the peace between Meereen and Yunkai. Queen Daenerys invites him to meet Rhaegal and Viserion . The dragons frighten Quentyn, but nonetheless he tells Daenerys about his own Targaryen ancestry . Daenerys tells him that he does not belong in Meereen, and urges him to return home, as her court is not a safe place for him. Quentyn refuses, and tells Daenerys about her namesake during their journey back up the pyramid. [2]  Quentyn tries to speak with Daenerys on the day Daznak's Pit is opened, but is denied an audience. He is in attendence when Daenerys disappears from Daznak's Pit atop Drogon , [22] and is later present when King Hizdahr is presented with Captain Groleo 's head. Barristan questions Quentyn about his possible involvement in the food which poisoned Belwas , but soon concludes that Quentyn is innocent. With Daenerys gone, Barristan advises the three Dornishmen to return home and forget about the pact, but Quentyn declines, stating that he cannot return to Dorne empty handed. [4]  Quentyn's companions are keen to return to Dorn, but the prince plans to tame at least one of Daenery's dragons due to his Targaryen ancestry. He arranges a meeting with the Tattered Prince, hiring the Windblown's help in seizing Rhaegal and Viserion. The Tattered Prince agrees, asking for Pentos in return. Quentyn signs an agreement. [3] Dressed as Brazen Beasts , Quentyn and his companions go to the pit where the dragons are kept. The Tattered Prince had given them the code word of "dog" to be used by the Brazen Beasts that day, but with Barristan's coup occurring at the same time, the Brazen Beasts guarding the door are not aware of the code word. Gaining access to the dragons, Quentyn eventually attempts to tame Viserion, but Rhaegal bathes Quentyn from behind with dragonfire . The Windblown mercenaries flee, and both dragons escape. [10]  Missandei takes care of Quentyn, but he dies in Daenerys's bed three days later, covered in burns. Upon seeing the extent of the prince's injuries, Barristan thinks it would have been better if Rhaegal had just eaten him alive, as his death would haven been quicker and less painful in such a case. [5] The imprisoned Archibald and Gerris claim Quentyn's actions were done for love of Daenerys, but Barristan insists they were done out of duty for Dorne. The surviving Dornish knights agree to act as Barristan's envoys to the Tattered Prince.

Keep in mind that the content as described below is still subject to change.  On her way to Griffin's Roost , Princess Arianne Martell wonders about where Quentyn would be if he does not turn out to be with Jon Connington . She wonders if he has wed Daenerys Targaryen . [23] Once at Griffin's Roost, her sworn shield , Ser Daemon Sand , states that they now know her brother is not at Storm's End . [24]   Quotes by Quentyn  Daenerys : Tell me, Prince Quentyn, are you enchanted?  Quentyn : No, Your Grace.   Daenerys : I feared as much. [9]  - Daenerys Targaryen and Quentyn I am a prince of Dorne , Your Grace. I will not run from slaves and sell swords . [4]  - Quentyn to Daenerys Targaryen    I want to go back to Yronwood and kiss both of your sisters , marry Gwyneth Yronwood , watch her flower into beauty, have a child by her. I want to ride in tourneys , hawk and hunt, visit my mother in Norvos , read some of those books my father sends me. I want Cletus and Will and Maester Kedry to be alive again. [10]  – Quentyn's thoughts   Quentyn had never felt so much a boy as when he'd stood before Daenerys Targaryen , pleading for her hand. The thought of bedding her terrified him almost as much as her dragons had. [10]  – Quentyn's thoughts   Quentyn : This will be my grand adventure.  Gerris : Men die on grand adventures. [10]  - Quentyn and Gerris Drinkwater    The hero sets out with his friends and companions, faces dangers, comes home triumphant. Only some of his companions don't return at all. The hero never dies, though. I must be the hero. [10]  – Quentyn's thoughts Quotes about Quentyn  Dorne will be yours. You have my word on that, if my word still has any meaning for you. Your brother Quentyn has a harder road to walk. [15]  – Doran Martell to Arianne Martell    That one is his father's son. Short and stocky, plain-faced, he seemed a decent lad, sober, sensible, dutiful ... but not the sort to make a young girl's heart beat faster. And Daenerys Targaryen , whatever else she might be, was still a young girl, as she herself would claim when it pleased her to play the innocent. Like all good queens she put her people first—else she would never have wed Hizdahr zo Loraq —but the girl in her still yearned for poetry, passion, and laughter. She wants fire, and Dorne sent her mud. You could make a poultice out of mud to cool a fever. You could plant seeds in mud and grow a crop to feed your children. Mud would nourish you, where fire would only consume you, but fools and children and young girls would choose fire every time. [4]  – Barristan Selmy 's thoughts   He should have stayed in Dorne . He should have stayed a frog. Not all men are meant to dance with dragons . [5]  - Barristan Selmy 's thoughts   Barristan : Prince Quentyn's death was his own doing, and yours.  Gerris : Ours? How are we at fault, ser? Quentyn was our friend, yes. A bit of a fool , you might say, but all dreamers are fools. But first and last he was our prince. We owed him our obedience.
