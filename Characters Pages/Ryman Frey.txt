His face is broad and fleshy and, according to Lady Catelyn Stark , stupid. Ryman has small eyes. [3] [4] Over forty years of age, he is reported to have a bad belly. [2]  Unlike his father Stevron , Ryman never received Lord Walder 's grooming on family values. [5]  Robb Stark considers Ryman dull-witted as a stone, [6] and Merrett Frey thinks Ryman is stubborn and greedy. [5]   History  Ser Ryman participated in the tourney at Lannisport , the tourney that was held to celebrate King Robert I Baratheon 's victory over Greyjoy's Rebellion . He was defeated by the eventual champion, Lord Jorah Mormont . [7]   Recent Events  A Clash of Kings  When Ser Stevron Frey dies following the wounds he received in the Battle of Oxcross , his son Ryman becomes heir of Lord Walder Frey . Learning about the death of Stevron by Maester Luwin in Winterfell , Big Walder Frey and Little Walder Frey discuss the line of succession in their house . Little Walder asks Big Walder whether Ryman, whom he thinks is past forty already and has a bad belly, will eventually become Lord of the Crossing , to which he receives an indifferent answer by Big Walder. The two are reprimanded by Luwin for not showing much grief over Stevron. [2]  Ryman participates in the westerlands campaign of Robb Stark , King in the North and King of the Trident . When Catelyn Stark criticizes Ser Edmure Tully for removing Ser Helman Tallhart from the Twins to aid Lord Roose Bolton , Edmure includes Ryman in his examples of loyal Frey support for House Stark . [8]   A Storm of Swords  After Robb marries Jeyne Westerling , slighting House Frey , Ryman strikes Robb's banner and leads his forces from the Crag back to the Twins . He takes Robb's squire Olyvar Frey along, although Olyvar asks to remain with the king. Robb later explains to Catelyn that, if Stevron had still been alive, he might have been able to make amends with the Freys in his host, but that was not possible with Ryman and his son Black Walder . [6]  When Robb Stark arrives at the Twins for the wedding of Edmure Tully , now Lord of Riverrun , and Roslin Frey , a curt Ryman and his three sons ride out to welcome him. [3]  During the wedding feast, Catelyn observe the sour Ryman perspiring while drinking wine, even though Ryman bathed in lemonwater. Ryman confirms for Catelyn that Olyvar and Alesander Frey , who are friendly to House Stark, are not present for the wedding, and he staggers from the hall. When the Freys and Boltons betray Robb, an armored Ryman storms back into the hall followed by soldiers armed with heavy longaxes, and he kills Dacey Mormont by thrusting his axe into her stomach. When Catelyn holds a dagger to the throat of Jinglebell to trade his life for Robb's, Ryman and his son Black Walder circle behind her back. Robb and Catelyn are both slain in what becomes known as the Red Wedding . [9]  Ryman takes two thousand spears to meet with Ser Daven Lannister and Ser Forley Prester to begin the siege of Riverrun . [10]  When Ryman's son, Petyr Frey , is taken hostage by the brotherhood without banners , Ryman's uncle, Merrett Frey , volunteers to deliver the ransom, believing this would put him in the good graces of Ryman and prevent him from kicking Merrett and his family out of the Twins when Ryman succeeds Lord Walder. According to Merrett, Ryman was one of the principal architects of the Red Wedding, together with Lord Walder and Lord Roose Bolton . The outlaws hang Merrett for his own involvement in the massacre. [5]   A Feast for Crows  As heir of Lord Walder Frey , Ryman commands the Frey forces at the siege of Riverrun , with the disorderly camp located north of the Tumblestone and hosting the largest of the three forces besieging the castle. He leaves the planning to his son Edwyn , so he can spend his time drinking and whoring. To upstage Genna Lannister , who has brought the singer Whitesmile Wat to the Lannister camp, Ryman hires a singer for his own camp as well, Tom of Sevenstreams , [11] [4] who is secretly a member of the outlaw brotherhood without banners . [12] The Freys have a large stock of provisions, but Ryman refuses to share with the forces led by Ser Daven Lannister , the new Warden of the West , and Ser Forley Prester , leaving them to rely on foraging, during which their men are sometimes caught and killed. [11]  Ryman's main contribution to the siege is building a large gallows, on which Lord Edmure Tully has to stand with a noose around the neck all day. The threat of execution is meant to make Edmure's uncle, Ser Brynden Tully , surrender Riverrun but instead it hardens the Blackfish's stance. In a half-drunken state, Ryman rides to the gate of Riverrun and tries to threaten Brynden into submission. However, the Blackfish puts an arrow into Ryman's horse, causing the panicked animal to throw him off and making Ryman a laughing stock to his allies and enemies. [11]  Ryman does not attend the war council called by Ser Jaime Lannister , the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard , sending his son Edwyn with the excuse that he is indisposed, which, as Daven points out, merely means that he is drunk. Edwyn tells Jaime that his father has stomach problems and wine helps him with his digestion. [4]  Jaime goes to the Frey camp to persuade Edmure into commanding the capitulation of Riverrun. On his way, Jaime notices Ryman entertaining a whore in his tent; also present is Tom o' Sevens. The woman has Robb Stark 's bronze crown on her head and states that Ryman crowned her the queen o' whores . When Ryman ignores the advice to remain silent in Jaime's presence and protests the assumed plan of the Lord Commander to execute Edmure, Jaime strikes Ryman with his golden hand and removes him from his position, replacing him with Edwyn. Jamie commands Ryman to leave the camp at once and to take his whore with him, but not the crown. [4]  On his way back to the Twins , Ryman and his escort of three knights and twelve men-at-arms are hanged near Fairmarket . When Jaime learns of this at Riverrun, Edwyn accuses him of having his father's blood on his hands, then suggests his own brother Black Walder might have been involved in the murder, although Black Walder is currently stationed at Seagard . Jaime notices that Edwyn is not mourning his father particularly and suspects that might be true for most Freys. Still, Jaime is bothered by the audacity of outlaws who kill the heir to the Crossing not far from the Twins. [13]   A Dance with Dragons  Ser Jaime Lannister ends the siege of Raventree and demands Lord Tytos Blackwood 's bookish son Hoster as hostage. When Hoster does not seem to take the situation seriously, Jaime reminds Tytos that his son will die, if he does not keep his word. In this context, Jaime stresses that he is no Ryman Frey, meaning that, unlike the farce Ryman staged with Lord Edmure Tully , Jaime is ready to execute a prisoner. [14]   Quotes by Ryman  If you would follow me, my father awaits. [3]  - Ryman to Robb Stark before the Red Wedding    Ryman : I have done nothing ...  Jaime : ... but drink and whore. I know. [4]  - Ryman and Jaime Lannister  Quotes about Ryman  Little Walder : Ryman is old too. Past forty, I bet. And he has a bad belly. Do you think he'll be lord ?  Big Walder : I'll be lord. I don't care if he is. [2]  - Little Walder Frey and Big Walder Frey    Tully ought to make a sortie, to remind us all we're still at war . Be nice if he culled some Freys too. Ryman, for a start. The man's drunk more oft than not. [11]  - Daven Lannister to Jaime Lannister    A sot, a fool, and a craven. Lord Walder had best outlive this one, or the Freys are done.
