[3]   Quotes by Hyle  His lordship informed me that he had no further need of my sword, or my insolence. It amounts to the same thing.

[4]  - Hyle to Brienne of Tarth    I am not Renly Baratheon , I confess it, but I have the virtue of being still amongst the living. Some would say that is my only virtue. Marriage would serve the both of us. [6]  - Hyle to Brienne of Tarth    Brienne : All lips are the same.  Hyle : And all lips are made for kissing.

[6]  - Brienne of Tarth and Hyle Quotes about Hyle  You think too much. [1]  - Randyll Tarly to Hyle   Hyle Hunt was no true knight . His honest face was just a mummer 's mask.
