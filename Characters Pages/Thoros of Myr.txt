[3] He shaves his head [4] [5] and has a smooth face. [6]  The genial Thoros enjoys wine , [7] joking that he became a red priest because the robes would hide winestains. [1] He is fond of feasts and tourneys , [3] has a gift for tongues, [2] and has some success seeing visions in flames. [2]  Thoros has a reputation as a brave madman with an absurd but dangerous firesword. [5] [3] The red priest is a great friend of King Robert I Baratheon . [3]   History  Thoros was born in the Free City of Myr , the youngest of eight children, and he was given to a red temple of R'hllor at a young age. He earned his priesthood but was never overly pious due to his tastes for fighting, drinking, and women. Thoros was sent to King's Landing in hopes he could convert the fire-obsessed King Aerys II Targaryen , but he was unsuccessful and started to question his own faith. [2]  During Robert's Rebellion , Thoros was present [6] when the corpses of Aegon and Rhaenys Targaryen , clothed in red cloaks to hide their wounds, were presented by Lord Tywin Lannister to Lord Robert Baratheon before the Iron Throne . [8] Thoros has never forgotten Ser Gregor Clegane 's brutality during the Sack of King's Landing . [6]  Thoros became a frequent drinking companion of the new king, Robert I. [2] During Greyjoy's Rebellion , Thoros earned recognition for being the first over the wall at Pyke . [4]  Thoros is a frequent tourney mêlée champion, using cheap swords set aflame with wildfire to spook the other combatants' horses. [5] Three times Thoros defeated Sandor Clegane in the mêlées. [6] At the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day , Thoros was defeated by Lord Yohn Royce with a common mace after the fire of his sword guttered out. [9]  Tobho Mott , displeased with the burning of swords, overcharges Thoros for replacements, [3] [2] but Robert is glad to provide for his friend. [10]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones   Thoros of Myr before joining the brotherhood , by The Mico ©.  Sansa Stark and Jeyne Poole giggle at Thoros in the Hand's tourney , where he unhorses Lord Beric Dondarrion . [4] Thoros wins the melee, which lasts three hours. [5]  Lord Eddard Stark , Hand of the King , tasks Thoros with recruiting twenty men to join the party of Beric, which is to seek out Ser Gregor Clegane and bring him to the king's justice. [11]  When war breaks out , Beric and Thoros raid the foraging parties of Lord Tywin Lannister . [12] [13] Both are named among those who must swear fealty to the newly-crowned King Joffrey I Baratheon or be adjudged traitors. [14]   A Clash of Kings  While Beric's band forages in the riverlands , Thoros pays smallfolk with paper notes. [15]   A Storm of Swords   Thoros of Myr after joining the brotherhood , by The Mico ©.  Harwin tells Arya Stark of the battle at the Mummer's Ford , when Gregor ambushed Beric's party. Thoros rallied Beric's horsemen and allowed Beric to escape. Thoros removed Gregor's lance from Beric and tried to treat the wound, [16] but the Lord of Blackhaven succumbed. While performing the last kiss , a traditional burial ritual of his faith, Thoros inadvertently resurrected Beric. The two men founded an outlaw group, the brotherhood without banners , to protect the smallfolk from soldiers foraging in the riverlands . The spiritually-reawakened Thoros continues to resurrect Beric through means beyond his understanding, [17] and he has greater success seeing visions in flames.

[2] Thoros has a vision of the siege of Riverrun . [2]   A Feast for Crows  After fighting Rorge and Biter at the crossroads inn , Brienne of Tarth is captured by the brotherhood. Thoros explains that when the brotherhood found the body of Lady Catelyn Stark after the Red Wedding , he refused to give her the last kiss and revive her. Beric passed the flame of life to Catelyn's corpse instead, and the so-called Lady Stoneheart now leads the brotherhood after Beric's passing. Her motives and methods lower Thoros's spirits. [19]   Quotes by Thoros  Sandor: Thoros of Myr . You used to shave your head.  Thoros: To betoken a humble heart, but in truth my heart was vain. Besides, I lost my razor in the woods. I am less than I was, but more. A year in the wild will melt the flesh off a man. Would that I could find a tailor to take in my skin. I might look young again, and pretty maids would shower me with kisses. [6]  – Sandor Clegane and Thoros   Yet I am not the false priest you knew. The Lord of Light has woken in my heart. Many powers long asleep are waking, and there are forces moving in the land. I have seen them in my flames. [6]  – Thoros to Sandor Clegane    Beric: Thoros, how many times have you brought me back now?  Thoros: It is R'hllor who brings you back, my lord. The Lord of Light. I am only his instrument. [17]  – Beric Dondarrion and Thoros   Gendry:  My master said you were a sot and a fraud, as bad a priest as there ever was.  Thoros: That was unkind. True, but unkind. [2]  – Gendry and Thoros   Brienne: You are the Myrish priest. The red wizard.  Thoros: The pink pretender, rather. I am Thoros, late of Myr, aye ... a bad priest and a worse wizard. [19]  – Brienne of Tarth and Thoros   Justice . I remember justice. It had a pleasant taste. Justice was what we were about when Beric led us, or so we told ourselves. We were king's men , knights , and heroes ... but some knights are dark and full of terror, my lady. War makes monsters of us all. [19]  – Thoros to Brienne of Tarth  Quotes about Thoros  The red wizard. I've heard tell he has strange powers. [1]  – Sharna to Jaime Lannister    Anguy: Thoros herding sheep?  Ravella: I grant you it was an odd sight, but Thoros claimed that as a priest he knew how to tend a flock. [3]  – Anguy and Ravella Smallwood    Arya: He isn't very priestly, is he?  Gendry: No. Master Mott said Thoros could outdrink even King Robert . They were pease in a pod, he told me, both gluttons and sots. [3]  – Arya Stark and Gendry    A grievous wound, aye, but Thoros healed it. There's never been no better healer. [17]  – Lem to Arya Stark  References    ↑ 1.0  1.1  1.2   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 11 , Jaime II.   ↑ 2.0  2.1  2.2  2.3  2.4  2.5  2.6  2.7  2.8  2.9   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 43 , Arya VIII.   ↑ 3.0  3.1  3.2  3.3  3.4  3.5  3.6  3.7   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 22 , Arya IV.   ↑ 4.0  4.1  4.2   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 29 , Sansa II.   ↑ 5.0  5.1  5.2  5.3   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 30 , Eddard VII.   ↑ 6.0  6.1  6.2  6.3  6.4  6.5  6.6  6.7  6.8   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 34 , Arya VI.   ↑   A Dance with Dragons , Chapter 22 , Tyrion VI.   ↑   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 45 , Eddard XII.   ↑   A Clash of Kings , Chapter 10 , Davos I.   ↑   A Clash of Kings , Chapter 20 , Tyrion V.   ↑   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 43 , Eddard XI.   ↑   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 58 , Eddard XV.   ↑   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 66 , Bran VII.   ↑   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 61 , Daenerys VII.   ↑   A Clash of Kings , Chapter 26 , Arya VI.   ↑   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 17 , Arya III.   ↑ 17.0  17.1  17.2  17.3   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 39 , Arya VII.   ↑   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 29 , Arya V.   ↑ 19.0  19.1  19.2   A Feast for Crows , Chapter 42 , Brienne VIII.
