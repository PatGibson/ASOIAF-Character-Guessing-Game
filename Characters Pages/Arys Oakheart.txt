 A Clash of Kings 
 While all of King  Joffrey I Baratheon 's Kingsguard knights (with the exception of  Sandor Clegane ) beat  Sansa Stark  on his orders, Sansa still regards Arys as one of the kinder knights of them, and prefers that he accompanies her over any of the others. Arys often makes pleasant conversation with Sansa, and when ordered by Joffrey to hit her, he does so as lightly as he dares, and only after objecting first. [4]  Arys accompanies Sansa to the  tourney on King Joffrey's name day , and expresses to her his confidence in his ability to win, though he admits that the competition is not as fierce as would be desired. Fond of gossip, he informs Sansa of Lord  Tywin Lannister 's refusal to march his army to  King's Landing  as Queen Regent  Cersei Lannister  had commanded. [4] 
 Arys is sent to  Sunspear  in  Dorne  as the  sworn shield  of Princess  Myrcella Baratheon , who is betrothed to Prince  Trystane Martell .

 A Feast for Crows 
 Arys is seduced within half a year of his arrival by Arianne, the daughter and heiress of  Doran Martell ,  Prince of Dorne . [10]  She convinces him to rebel against the  Iron Throne  and support Myrcella's claim over that of her brother, King  Tommen I Baratheon , [5]  secretly part of an attempt to claim her of birthright. [2]  Arys brings Myrcella to Arianne's company of friends, and they travel to the  Greenblood , where they are confronted by Prince Doran's guards, as their conspiracy has been uncovered. Arys charges into the  Martell  forces, killing two of them in the process despite being injured. When his horse goes down, Arys manages to struggle free, but  Areo Hotah , Prince Doran's captain of guard, reaches him and kills him with his axe when Arys raises his sword too slowly. [2] 
 Later, during her time of captivity, Princess Arianne has nightmares about Arys's death. When summoned before her father, Prince Doran informs her that Ser  Balon Swann , Arys's  sworn brother , is traveling towards Sunspear, and is expecting to see Arys upon arrival. To hide the truth of Arys's death from Swann, Arianne tells her father they should say that Arys died defending Myrcella. [10]
