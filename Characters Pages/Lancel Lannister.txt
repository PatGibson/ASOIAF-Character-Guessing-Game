He has green eyes and sandy hair. [3] Lancel is humorless, self-assured, arrogant, and impatient. [3] [4]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones  Alongside his cousin Tyrek , Lancel serves as squire to King Robert I Baratheon , and is directly responsible for his death. On the request of another cousin, Queen Cersei Lannister , Lancel provides the king with a large dose of strongwine as Robert tracks an enormous boar while hunting in the kingswood . [4] The boar mortally wounds Robert. [5]   A Clash of Kings   Ser Lancel Lannister - by Henning Ludvigsen ©  In payment for his service, Cersei has Lancel knighted and takes him into her bed. [6] Although the affair elicits strong emotions from Lancel, Cersei eventually grows bored and rebuffs him. Cersei's brother, Tyrion Lannister , suspects the affair and gets Lancel to admit to it, blackmailing him into spying on Cersei for him. [4] Lancel survives the riot of King's Landing . [7]  Lancel fights in the Battle of the Blackwater , though he is severely injured. For his services, Lancel's uncle and Hand of the King , Lord Tywin Lannister , names him the new Lord of Darry in the riverlands , as a sop to his brother and Lancel's father, Ser Kevan Lannister . [8] [9]   A Storm of Swords  Lancel recovers from the injuries he sustained at the Blackwater, but his appearance is substantially changed in the process. No longer comely, he looks like a much older man and his hair has turned white and brittle. The High Septon is instrumental in his recovery and Lancel develops a new-found piety to the Faith of the Seven . As part of the pact between Lord Tywin Lannister and Lord Walder Frey concerning the betrayal of Robb Stark , Lancel is wed to Amerei Frey , a granddaughter of Walder's. [10]   A Feast for Crows  Lancel, the head of House Lannister of Darry , reluctantly takes his lordship of the lands of Darry and is ambivalent as to rumors of his new wife's promiscuity. Ser Jaime Lannister visits Lancel at Darry and, under questioning, Lancel admits to having slept with Cersei as well as to having supplied Robert I Baratheon with the strongwine. Shortly afterwards, Lancel leaves his wife and castle in order to swear service as part of the newly-reformed Faith Militant . [11]   A Dance with Dragons  Lancel is seen having joined the Warrior's Sons , a division of highborn knights devoted to the Seven. Under the command of Ser Theodan the True , he makes up part of Cersei's escort in her walk of atonement . [12]   Quotes about Lancel  Look at him. Not quite so tall, his features not so fine, and his hair is sand instead of spun gold, yet still … even a poor copy of Jaime is sweeter than an empty bed, I suppose. [4]  – Tyrion Lannister 's thoughts   Have you given any thought to what Joffrey will do when I tell him you murdered his father to bed his mother? [4]  – Tyrion Lannister to Lancel   Knighting him was a mistake, and bedding him was a bigger one. [9]  – Cersei Lannister 's thoughts   He may be Kevan's son, but he has milk in his veins. Tyrion was lying to me. His words were meant to wound. [13]  – Jaime Lannister 's thoughts   The Imp was lying. Cersei would sooner have Robert 's corpse between her legs than a pious fool like Lancel. Tyrion , you evil bastard, you should have lied about someone more likely.
