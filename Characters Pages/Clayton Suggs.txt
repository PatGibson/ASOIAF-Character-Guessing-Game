 Appearance and Character 
 Clayton is a short burly man with a balding head [3]  and a mouthful of broken brown teeth. [4]  He has pig eyes and blackheads on his nose. [5]  Clayton has a deep voice [6]  and is older than Lord  Harwood Fell . [4] 
 Clayton is considered a crony [4]  and the strong right hand of Ser  Godry Farring . [5]  He is strong and courageous but also crude and brutish. [4] [5]  Clayton is cruel and enjoys torturing, and his love for the  Lord of Light  may only be love of human sacrifice. [5] 
 
 History 
 Clayton was a  hedge knight [4]  of  lowborn  origin [7]  hailing from  Flea Bottom  in  King's Landing . According to Ser  Justin Massey , Clayton gambled with  Dragonstone 's torturers and aided them in the questioning of prisoners, especially young women. [5]

   Suggs rips his longsword from its scabbard - by Marc Fishman © 
 Clayton is part of Stannis's honor guard when  free folk  pass through the  Wall  to  Castle Black  after the  battle beneath the Wall . [6]  During Stannis's war council, Clayton states that Houses  Hornwood ,  Cerwyn ,  Tallhart ,  Ryswell  and  Dustin  are all traitors and lapdogs of the  Lannisters . When Stannis dismisses his men during a meeting with  Jon Snow , the  Lord Commander of the Night's Watch , Clayton mutters something to  Harwood Fell  that makes him laugh. [4] 
 When Stannis's army is slowed during the  march on Winterfell , Clayton agrees with Ser  Godry Farring  they should burn someone to appease  R'hllor  and end the blizzard, but the king refuses. [8]   Asha Greyjoy  fears Clayton will burn her because of her king's blood, as her father  Balon  was  King of the Isles and the North . [5] 
 When four  Peasebury  men are caught committing cannibalism at a  crofters' village , they are to be burned alive as a sacrifice to R'hllor. Desiring a quick death, their serjeant insults the queen's men. Clayton is goaded into quickly killing the condemned man with a knife after being called a bleeding  bastard . [5]  Clayton insults Asha after the sacrifices are burned, but he is interrupted by  Alysane Mormont  and Ser  Justin Massey . [5] 
 When Asha later reminds Clayton that Stannis gelds men for rape, he laughs and says he would sooner see her burn. [5]  When they hear riders approaching the village, Clayton tells Asha to run and warn the king, as he assumes it is Lord  Roose Bolton 's host upon them. However, the riders turn out to be  Tycho Nestoris  of the  Iron Bank of Braavos  and his escort, some of whom are Asha's  ironborn  men from  Deepwood Motte .
