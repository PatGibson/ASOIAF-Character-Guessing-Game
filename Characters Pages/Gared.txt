 Appearance and Character 
 See also:  Images of Gared 
 Gared is past fifty. He lost both ears, three toes and the little finger of his left hand to the cold. [1]  Old and scrawny, [2]  he is considered an experienced ranger. [5]  Gared is known to make fun of Ser  Waymar Royce  because of the fine clothes the inexperienced lordling wears. [1] 
 
 History 
 Gared joined the  Night's Watch  as a boy and spent forty years as a ranger. When Gared's ears had frostbite one winter, Maester  Aemon  had to cut them off. [1] 
 
   Dermot Keaney as Gared in  Game of Thrones 
 Shortly before  A Song of Ice and Fire  starts, Gared,  Will , and Ser  Waymar Royce  were sent ranging into the  haunted forest  by  Jeor Mormont ,  Lord Commander of the Night's Watch , in search of a band of  wildling  raiders. Jeor gave the command to Waymar, although he was the least experienced of the three, whereas Jeor counted Gared and Will among his best men. However, Waymar felt it was his due to have a command because he was a  knight , and the Lord Commander accepted because he did not want to offend Waymar's father, Lord  Yohn Royce . [5]

Waymar orders Gared to remain with the horses while he and Will walk the last part. Waymar refuses to allow Gared to make a fire. After Waymar is slain by  Others , the knight rises as a  wight  and kills Will. [1]

[5]
