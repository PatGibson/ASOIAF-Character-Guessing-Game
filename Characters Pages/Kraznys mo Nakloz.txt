[1]   Recent Events  A Storm of Swords  Kraznys showed Daenerys Targaryen the Unsullied when she came to Astapor . Daenerys feigns ignorance and pretends she does not speak the Valyrian language so Kraznys speaks to her via a slave girl named Missandei . He insults Daenerys several times during the buying unaware she understood every word he said. [1]  When she wanted to buy them, Kraznys was the one who bartered the deal that she be sold every Unsullied in Astapor in exchange for a dragon . The exchange was done on the Plaza of Punishment, but Drogon (the dragon chosen by the slavers) refused to obey him. Daenerys answered that a dragon is no slave, and ordered Drogon to unleash a jet of flame into Kraznys' face. The Unsullied, who now belonged to her, did not lift a finger to help their former masters and are quickly ordered to eliminate all slavers. [2]   A Dance with Dragons  It was mentioned by survivors of the Siege of Astapor that the pyramid of Kraznys mo Nakloz was set aflame by the population of Astapor when the Yunkai besieged the city, because they blamed the late Kraznys for their woes. [3]   Quotes  Tell her to look at the soldiers. Even the dim purple eyes of a sunset savage can see how magnificent my creatures are surely.
