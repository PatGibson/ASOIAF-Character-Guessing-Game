He is strong and fast. He opens the series as a boy of fourteen years. [9]  Robb wears a surcoat over his armor and carries an oak shield decorated with a direwolf 's head. [10] [1]  Robb is his father Eddard's son, with a keen sense of justice. He shares his father's devotion to honor and is frequently accompanied by his direwolf , Grey Wind .  History  Robb was conceived during the first fortnight of the marriage of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully [1] - on the wedding night at Riverrun, according to Catelyn. [11] While Eddard rode south to fight in Robert's Rebellion , Catelyn remained at House Tully 's castle. Near the end of the war, she gave birth at Riverrun [1] with the aid of Maester Luwin . [12] After war ended Catelyn travelled to Winterfell with Robb. [13]  Robb was raised at Winterfell as his father's heir, and is the closest of companions with his half-brother Jon Snow . [13] Robb and Jon trained together at arms ever since they were big enough to walk, and played at being mighty knights and heroes. [14] Once, Robb and Jon built a great mountain of snow above a gate. They were spotted by Mance Rayder , then a brother of the Night's Watch , who had accompanied the visiting Lord Commander Qorgyle . Mance promised not to tell on them, and the two boys eventually dumped the snow on Fat Tom , the slowest of Lord Eddard's household guards , who chased them around afterward. [15]  After Greyjoy's Rebellion in 289 AC , Eddard brought to Winterfell a hostage, Theon Greyjoy , the last surviving son of Lord Balon Greyjoy . Robb came to befriend Theon and enjoy the elder boy's company. [16] [4] Theon joined Robb and Jon in their training at arms, [17] and Robb and Theon trained at swordfighting at the staircases of Winterfell. [18]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones   Robb Stark captures Jaime Lannister - by Mathia Arkoniel ©  Robb attends the execution of Gared and discovers a litter of six direwolf pups in the snow. He claims one of the direwolves for his own and names him Grey Wind . [9] Shortly after the court of King Robert I Baratheon arrives at Winterfell , Robb spars with the crown prince, Joffrey , using wooden swords. Bad blood develops between the two when Joffrey challenges Robb to spar with live steel. Ser Rodrik Cassel , Winterfell's master-at-arms, does not allow it, to the mockery and chagrin of many of the present Lannister retainers. [12]  When his father Eddard is named Hand of the King to Robert and journeys south to King's Landing , Robb remains in Winterfell to rule in his father's stead with the help of his his mother, Catelyn Stark . [12] She later travels to King's Landing after an assassin tries to kill Bran Stark , so the responsibility of Winterfell falls solely on Robb. [2] Robb and Theon Greyjoy rescue the crippled Bran from wildlings and deserters from the Night's Watch in the wolfswood . [16]  After word of Eddard's arrest in King's Landing for treason against the late king Robert's successor, Joffrey, reaches Winterfell, Robb calls the Stark bannermen to war. His youth and experience is questioned by his father's bannermen, such as Jon Umber , but he manages to unite them behind him. [19] When Robb marches south to the riverlands , his motives are to support his mother's house, House Tully , in response to the invasion of Lannisters from the westerlands , and with the ultimate goal of freeing Eddard. [20] Robb resides in the Gatehouse Tower while encamped at Moat Cailin . [20] Bran remains at Winterfell with Maester Luwin [19] and Rodrik Cassel. [20]  Upon learning that Riverrun has been besieged by a host led by Ser Jaime Lannister , whilst another force led by Lord Tywin Lannister approaches from the south, Robb splits his forces, sending his foot under the command of Lord Roose Bolton to engage Tywin's army, while crossing the Green Fork at the Twins with the majority of his horse. [20] His goal is to ride to and lift the siege of Riverrun. For allowing him crossing and his allegiance at the Twins, Lord Walder Frey extracts the price of a marriage contract, ensuring that Robb will marry a daughter of his house to be chosen after the war is finished. [10]  Robb leads his horsemen to Riverrun, where, aided by the counsel of his great-uncle, Ser Brynden Tully , he achieves complete surprise in ambushing Jaime's army in the Whispering Wood , annihilating Jaime's forces and taking Jaime captive. [1] Robb is protected by a company of highborn warriors who become his friends and companions. Shortly thereafter Robb is able to lift the siege of Riverrun through the Battle of the Camps , [21] scattering Jaime's remaining forces. This forces Tywin's army, which had scored a victory against Roose Bolton's foot in the battle on the Green Fork , to retreat back to Harrenhal . [22]  Upon Eddard's execution in King's Landing at the command of King Joffrey, effectively ending the possibility of peace between Stark and Lannister, Robb is crowned at Riverrun by his bannermen and the river lords as the King in the North . [21] The rivermen later grant him the title King of the Trident . [23]  Jon Snow leaves Castle Black so he can help his half brother, Robb, but Jon's new brothers in the Night's Watch convince him to return to the Night's Watch. [24]   A Clash of Kings   King Robb Stark and Grey Wind - by C.Griffin ©  Riverrun's smith creates for Robb a crown inspired by the ancient crowns of the Kings of Winter . The bronze circlet depicts runes of the First Men and is decorated with nine black iron spikes shaped like longswords. [25]  Remaining idle for a time at Riverrun, Robb sends Theon Greyjoy , who fought with him in the Whispering Wood , to Pyke with the goal of securing an alliance with his father, Lord Balon , against the Lannisters in exchange for recognition of the independence of the Iron Islands . [25] Theon is rebuffed outright by Balon, who responds to the offer for peace with a large-scale invasion of the north . [26] [27]  Robb also sends his mother, Catelyn , south to treat with the late King Robert's youngest brother, Renly Baratheon , who has crowned himself king. [25] [28] Catelyn is unable to secure any meaningful treaty with either Renly [28] or his elder brother Stannis , who has besieged Renly's seat of Storm's End after also declaring himself king. [29] Catelyn flees back to Riverrun after witnessing Renly's assassination . [27] [30]  Having sent Theon and Catelyn on their ultimately unsuccessful missions, Robb heads west to deal with Stafford Lannister 's host before it is fully trained. [25] Catelyn's brother, Ser Edmure Tully , holds Riverrun and guards Robb's rear. [30] Bypassing the Golden Tooth using a goat track found by Grey Wind , Robb smashes Stafford's host in the Battle of Oxcross and has his bannermen plunder parts of the westerlands . [30] He captures several castles, including Ashemark , [31] seat of House Marbrand , and the Crag , [32] seat of House Westerling .  A Storm of Swords  At the Crag , Robb suffers a wound and is tended by Jeyne Westerling . There he learns that a small force led by his one-time friend, Theon Greyjoy , has taken Winterfell and murdered his younger brothers Bran and Rickon , although the two youths actually escaped. Jeyne comforts Robb upon his hearing this news, which leads to his taking her maidenhood. In an effort to preserve her honor, Robb weds her immediately thereafter. [33] The Frey host that had accompanied Robb into the westerlands are furious and withdraw their support. Robb returns to Riverrun with his new wife in tow, much to his mother Catelyn's horror as, having pledged to wed a daughter of House Frey, this was not a slight that Lord Walder Frey is likely to overlook. [33]  Other problems await Robb in Riverrun: Ser Edmure Tully , acting Lord Paramount of the Trident whilst his father Hoster Tully lays on his deathbed, met Tywin Lannister 's army as they attempted to cross the Red Fork at a ford near Riverrun and threw them back. While the Battle of the Fords prevented Tywin's force from approaching Robb's from the rear, Robb's plan had been to entangle Tywin's army in a chase in the west while Stannis Baratheon marched on King's Landing . Being thrown back at Riverrun allowed Tywin's force to turn around and arrive at the capital in time for the Battle of the Blackwater , which turned the tide of the battle, and indeed the war, in House Lannister 's favor. [33] With problems on every side, Robb seems only to take solace in the company of the Westerlings : his loving wife Jeyne, her brother Ser Raynald his banner-bearer, and their younger brother, Robb's new squire Rollam . With all others, he is the solemn King in the North. Additionally, Robb learns that in her grief over the supposed murder of two of her sons, Catelyn released Jaime Lannister from captivity and entrusted him with a mission to return her daughters Sansa and Arya to her, if possible. [33] This earns her the enmity of Lord Rickard Karstark , as Jaime had slain two of Rickard's sons in the Whispering Wood ; Rickard requires vengeance for their deaths. In response to Jaime's release, Lord Karstark sends his horsemen to search the countryside for Jaime and then leads a small group in murdering two prisoners, Tion Frey and Willem Lannister , in a tower of Riverrun. For this crime, Robb sentences him to death and beheads Lord Rickard himself. [6]    Robb is betrayed and murdered in front of his mother Catelyn at the Red Wedding - by nejna ©  After the death of Hoster Tully, Robb intends to return to the north , reclaim his territory, much of which has been conquered by the ironborn , and avenge the deaths of Bran and Rickon. Aware that he slighted Walder Frey in his marriage to Jeyne Westerling, Robb suggests that Edmure Tully wed one of Lord Walder's daughters in his stead, a proposal to which Edmure reluctantly agrees. [34] Leaving Jeyne behind at Riverrun, Robb takes his host north toward the Twins, where Edmure is to marry Lord Walder's daughter, Roslin . [11]  Because he believes his brothers dead and Arya lost, and fearing that, by the laws of succession, were he to die without issue, Winterfell and the north would go to Sansa's new husband, Tyrion Lannister , Robb discusses the matter of his succession with his mother. To her chagrin, he suggests that, if he were to die, his bastard half-brother Jon Snow should succeed him. At Hag's Mire , Robb sends Maege Mormont and Galbart Glover north to Howland Reed at Greywater Watch to procure guides which will enable Robb to attack the ironborn unawares at Moat Cailin . Robb provides letters containing false orders in order to protect Maege and Galbart if they are captured. Robb has a small group of supporters—Catelyn, Edmure, Maege, Galbart, Jason Mallister , and Greatjon Umber —witness his choice of successor, [11] which according to a semi-canon source is a legitimized Jon Snow. [13]  Because Grey Wind is aggressive toward Freys when Robb arrives at the Twins, the direwolf is penned up. Robb apologizes to Lord Frey and receives salt and bread. [35] Despite guest right , Walder betrays Robb during the feast after the wedding of Roslin and Edmure. In what is later known as the Red Wedding , Robb's companions and men are murdered by Freys, fur-clad northmen, and sellswords disguised as musicians. Catelyn watches Roose Bolton deliver the final blow to her son, stabbing him through the heart. [36] Driven mad with despair, Catelyn murders Walder's lackwit grandson Jinglebell and is killed shortly thereafter herself. [36] Grey Wind, who had been chained to placate the Freys, is also slain via crossbow bolts, his head removed and sewn onto Robb's body as a final insult to the King in the North. [37]   A Dance with Dragons  The Frey envoys at White Harbor tell the Merman's Court that Robb turned into a wolf and slew the knights Wendel Manderly , Tytos Frey , and Garse Goodbrook . [38] Wendel's father, Lord Wyman Manderly , later assures Lord Davos Seaworth he does not believe the Frey lies, and Wyman tasks Davos with finding Robb's youngest brother, Rickon Stark . [39]   Quotes by Robb  Robb: I can't release the Kingslayer , not even if I wanted to. My lords would never abide it.  Catelyn: Your lords made you their king.   Robb: And can unmake me just as easy. [25]   – Robb and Catelyn Stark    Love’s not always wise, I’ve learned. It can lead us to great folly, but we follow our hearts ... wherever they take us. [33]  – Robb, to Catelyn Stark    I’ve made a botch of everything but the battles, haven’t I? I thought the battles would be the hard part, but ... if I had listened to you and kept Theon as my hostage, I’d still rule the north, and Bran and Rickon would be alive and safe in Winterfell. [33]  – Robb, to Catelyn Stark    Robb: Greatjon, keep Lord Karstark here till I return, and hang the other seven.  Greatjon: Even the dead ones?  Robb: Yes. I will not have such fouling my lord uncle’s rivers. Let them feed the crows .  Captive: Mercy, sire. I killed no one, I only stood at the door to watch for guards.  Robb: Did you know what Lord Rickard intended? Did you see the knives drawn? Did you hear the shouts, the screams, the cries for mercy?  Captive: Aye, I did, but I took no part. I was only the watcher, I swear it...   Robb: Lord Umber, this one was only the watcher. Hang him last, so he may watch the others die. [6]   – Robb and Jon Umber     Brynden: You know that for a certainty? That this will make young Karstark your enemy?  Robb: What else would he be? I am about to kill his father, he’s not like to thank me.  Brynden: He might. There are sons who hate their fathers, and in a stroke you will make him Lord of Karhold .   Robb: Even if Harrion were that sort, he could never openly forgive his father’s killer. His own men would turn on him. These are northmen, Uncle. The north remembers. [6]   – Robb and Brynden Tully    Gods be good, why would any man ever want to be king? When everyone was shouting King in the North, King in the North, I told myself ... swore to myself ... that I would be a good king, as honorable as Father, strong, just, loyal to my friends and brave when I faced my enemies ... now I can’t even tell one from the other. How did it all get so confused? Lord Rickard’s fought at my side in half a dozen battles. His sons died for me in the Whispering Wood. Tion Frey and Willem Lannister were my enemies. Yet now I have to kill my dead friends’ father for their sakes. [6]  - Robb to Brynden Tully    I have won every battle, yet somehow I'm losing the war. [34]  - Robb to Catelyn Stark    Catelyn: You would not be the first king to bend the knee, nor even the first Stark .  Robb: Never.  Catelyn: There is no shame in it. Balon Greyjoy bent the knee to Robert when his rebellion failed . Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror rather than see his army face the fires .   Robb: Did Aegon kill King Torrhen’s father? [34]   – Robb and Catelyn Stark    If you keep all your treasures in one purse, you only make it easier for those who would rob you. [11]  - Robb to Catelyn Stark  Quotes about Robb  No sword is strong until it’s been tempered. The Stark boy is a child. No doubt he likes the sound of warhorns well enough, and the sight of his banners fluttering in the wind, but in the end it comes down to butcher’s work. I doubt he has the stomach for it. [3]   – Tywin Lannister to Kevan Lannister    Varys:  Cersei is frightened of you, my lord ... but she has other enemies she fears even more. Her beloved Jaime is fighting the river lords even now. Lysa Arryn sits in the Eyrie , ringed in stone and steel, and there is no love lost between her and the queen. In Dorne , the Martells still brood on the murder of Princess Elia and her babes. And now your son marches down the Neck with a northern host at his back.  Eddard: Robb is only a boy.   Varys: A boy with an army. [40]   – Varys and Eddard Stark    There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m’lords. The King in the North ! [21]  – Jon Umber to the northern bannermen   He is a boy no longer, she realized with a pang. He is sixteen now, a man grown. Just look at him. War had melted all the softness from his face and left him hard and lean. [33]  - thoughts of Catelyn Stark    Robb Stark had won more battles in a year than the Lord of Highgarden had in twenty. [41]  – Tyrion Lannister 's thoughts   The Young Wolf remains unbeaten in the field. [41]  – Petyr Baelish to Paxter Redwyne    Yes, Lord Umber, leave me to the king. He means to give me a scolding before he forgives me. That’s how he deals with treason, our King in the North . Or should I call you the King Who Lost the North, Your Grace? [6]   – Rickard Karstark to Jon Umber and Robb   If you had to fall into a woman’s arms , my son, why couldn’t they have been Margaery Tyrell ’s? [42]  – Catelyn Stark 's thoughts   Tyrion : He foreswore himself, shamed an ally , betrayed a solemn promise. Where is the honor in that?  Kevan : He chose the girl ’s honor over his own. Once he had deflowered her, he had no other course. [41]   – Tyrion Lannister and Kevan Lannister    He won the war on the battlefield and lost it in a bedchamber. [43]   – Jaime Lannister 's thoughts   More beast than boy, that one, puffed up with pride and bloodlust ... Robb Stark betrayed us all. He abandoned the north to the cruel mercies of the ironmen to carve out a fairer kingdom for himself along the Trident . Then he abandoned the riverlords who had risked much and more for him, breaking his marriage pact with my grandfather to wed the first western wench who caught his eye. The Young Wolf? He was a vile dog and died like one . [38]  - Rhaegar Frey to the Merman's Court    Robb who had been more a brother to Theon than any son born of Balon Greyjoy 's loins. Murdered at the Red Wedding , butchered by the Freys . I should have been with him. Where was I? I should have died with him. [18]  - thoughts of Theon Greyjoy  Family                 Beron  Lorra Royce                                                                                           Donnor  Lyanne Glover  Willam  Melantha Blackwood  Berena  Lysara Karstark  Artos  Alysanne  Errold  Rodrik  Arya Flint                                                                                            Brandon  Jocelyn  Benedict Royce  Edwyle  Marna Locke  Brandon  Benjen    Harrold Rogers  Branda                                                                    House Royce             Issue  Issue                                                                             Rickard                      Lyarra                                                                                                               Brandon  Catelyn Tully  Eddard              Lyanna  Benjen                                                                                Jeyne Westerling  Robb  Sansa  Tyrion Lannister  Arya  Brandon  Rickon  Jon Snow        References    ↑ 1.0  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 63 , Catelyn X.   ↑ 2.0  2.1   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 24 , Bran IV.   ↑ 3.0  3.1   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 56 , Tyrion VII.   ↑ 4.0  4.1   A Clash of Kings , Chapter 11 , Theon I.   ↑   A Clash of Kings , Chapter 37 , Theon III.   ↑ 6.0  6.1  6.2  6.3  6.4  6.5   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 20 , Catelyn III.   ↑ 7.0  7.1  See the Robb Stark calculation.   ↑  Cast and Crew on HBO   ↑ 9.0  9.1   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 1 , Bran I.   ↑ 10.0  10.1   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 59 , Catelyn IX.   ↑ 11.0  11.1  11.2  11.3   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 45 , Catelyn V.   ↑ 12.0  12.1  12.2   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 6 , Catelyn II.   ↑ 13.0  13.1  13.2   George R.
