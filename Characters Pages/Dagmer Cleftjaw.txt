A longaxe blow nearly killed him as a child, splintering his jaw, smashing his front teeth and leaving him four lips instead of two. He has a shaggy beard, but the hair does not grow where the scar is. Dagmer wears many rings, gold and silver and bronze, set with sapphire and garnet and dragonglass , all of which he won by the iron price . [2]  Dagmer is proud but not prickly. He often smiles to show approval. [2]   History  In his youth, Dagmer Cleftjaw was the most dreaded warrior of the Iron Islands . Dagmer once spent a summer reaving in the Stepstones with a young Balon Greyjoy . [3] Dagmer trained Balon's son Theon Greyjoy in arms, riding, and boatmanship. [2] Theon gets on well with the old raider, [4] whom he calls "Uncle" on account of his having a female Greyjoy ancestor four or five generations back. [2]   Recent Events  A Clash of Kings   Dagmer Cleftjaw leading a large crew of House Greyjoy warriors, by Tomasz Jedruszek © Fantasy Flight Games  Lord Balon Greyjoy sends Dagmer to Old Wyk to raise the Stonehouses and the Drumms . [4] After Dagmer successfully raises the houses, he is ordered to accompany Balon's son, Theon , and Balon's brother, Aeron , during the harrying of the Stony Shore . [5] When Theon attacks a northern village, Dagmer laughs and obeys when Theon orders him to stay behind and defend the eight longships. [2]  When Theon returns from the scene of the massacre, he convinces Dagmer to follow his plan to take Winterfell , playing on the old reaver's lust for glory. Aeron will take six ships, excepting Theon's Sea Bitch and Dagmer's Foamdrinker , and continue raiding the coast of the north. Dagmer is to attack Torrhen's Square and draw out the garrison from Winterfell when its castellan, Ser Rodrik Cassel , learns of the fearsome ironborn warrior. Dagmer objects that sieges are not the Old Way and he would have not enough men to storm Torrhen's Square or defeat Rodrik's garrison, but Theon says he intends to slip in and take the under-manned Winterfell while the garrison is away. [2]  Dagmer loses the fight at Torrhen's Square and leads the survivors back to the Stony Shore , [6] but his distraction of Rodrik allows Theon to seize Winterfell . [6]   A Storm of Swords  At some point after Rodrik and Leobald Tallhart , the castellan of Torrhen's Square, depart to retake Winterfell , Dagmer returns and his ironmen take the sparsely defended keep at Torrhen's Square. [7]   A Dance with Dragons  Dagmer continues to hold Torrhen's Square with his force of ironborn. [8]   Quotes by Dagmer  The day is won , and yet you do not smile, boy. The living should smile, for the dead cannot. [2] —Dagmer to Theon Greyjoy   These old knights are more cunning than you think, or they would never have lived to see their first grey hair. [2] —Dagmer to Theon Greyjoy   Quotes about Dagmer  He gave me more smiles than my father and Eddard Stark together. [2] — Theon Greyjoy 's thoughts   His hair is white and his teeth are rotten, but he still has a taste for glory. [2] — Theon Greyjoy 's thoughts   If I had a man like you in my service, I should not waste him on this child's business of harrying and burning. This is no work for Lord Balon's best man...
