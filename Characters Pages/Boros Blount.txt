 Appearance and Character 
 See also:  Images of Boros Blount 
 Boros is an ugly man with a broad chest and short, bandy legs. He has a flat nose and jowls. [1]   Bran Stark  considers him bald [2]  while  Sansa Stark  notices brittle grey hair. [1]  Boros is sometimes attired in white velvet, with a snowy cloak fastened with a golden lion brooch with tiny ruby eyes. [1] 
 Boros is short-tempered. [3]   Jaime Lannister  describes him as an angry paper shield. [4]   Varys  considers Boros to be loyal to  Cersei Lannister . [5]  Many characters think of Boros with contempt due to the man's cowardice. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [4] [11] 
 
 History 
 Boros took part in the  tourney at Lannisport  in  289 AC , where he was defeated by the eventual champion, Ser  Jorah Mormont . [12] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Game of Thrones 
 With his sworn brothers Ser  Meryn Trant  and Ser  Jaime Lannister , Boros escorts King  Robert I Baratheon  to  Winterfell . [2]  According to  Varys , Boros and Meryn, despite their oath to Robert, are Queen  Cersei Lannister 's creatures. [5]  Boros is present in the throne room when Ser  Barristan Selmy  is dismissed by Cersei, and he laughs at his former sworn brother's shame. [6] 
 
 A Clash of Kings 
 Boros does not hesitate to hit  Sansa Stark  again and again on order of King  Joffrey I Baratheon . [3] [7]  Sansa considers him the worst member of the  Kingsguard . [13]  Boros survives the  riot of King's Landing , when the royal procession is attacked on its return to the  Red Keep  after seeing Princess  Myrcella Baratheon  off to  Dorne . [8] 
 Boros is arrested and later removed from the Kingsguard by Cersei. This is due to his surrender without a fight to  Tyrion Lannister 's men when he was escorting Prince  Tommen Baratheon  on the  road  to the castle of  Rosby . He is replaced by Ser  Osmund Kettleblack . Tyrion reflects on the matter:
 
 Even if Ser  Osmund  proved an utter craven, he would be no worse than Ser Boros Blount, currently residing in a dungeon at  Rosby . Ser Boros had been escorting  Tommen  and Lord  Gyles  when Ser  Jacelyn Bywater  and his  gold cloaks  had surprised them, and had yielded up his charge with an alacrity that would have enraged old Ser  Barristan Selmy  as much as it did  Cersei ; a knight of the Kingsguard was supposed to die in defense of the king and royal family. His sister had insisted Joffrey strip Blount of his white cloak on the grounds of treason and cowardice. [9] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
 Boros is reinstated to the  Kingsguard  by Lord  Tywin Lannister  upon his return as  Hand of the King , to fill the vacancy left by  Sandor Clegane  when he deserted during the  battle of the Blackwater . [10]  During the trial of Tyrion for the  death of King Joffrey , Boros recounts the tale of Tyrion beating Joffrey after the riot and the threat against Joffrey's life. [14] 
 After the death of Joffrey, the  Lord Commander of the Kingsguard , Ser  Jaime Lannister , makes Boros the official food taster of the new king,  Tommen I Baratheon , a shameful post for any knight. Blount is enraged at this and states that Jamie should be the food taster since he has lost his sword hand. Jaime states that if Boros is unhappy he can duel Jaime, causing Blount to spit at his feet and leave the room angrily. [4] 
 
 A Feast for Crows 
 Boros and Ser  Osmund Kettleblack  bring the news of Lord  Tywin 's death to Queen Regent  Cersei Lannister . [15]  He and Osmund are later ordered by Cersei to murder the two turnkeys who fell asleep the night  Tyrion Lannister  escaped from the  black cells ; they are reprimanded by Lord Commander  Jaime Lannister  for mindlessly killing the only two leads. [16]  In Dorne, Ser  Arys Oakheart  thinks of Boros and his familiarity with the  Street of Silk  in  King's Landing . [17] 
 Cersei, when she frames  Margaery Tyrell  for treason, plans on Boros being the only Kingsguard knight available if Margaery asks for  trial by combat , as Cersei believes Boros would be no match for any champion named by the  Faith of the Seven . [18]  When Cersei inquires about Boros's fighting skill she is assured by Osmund that he is an inept fighter. [19] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Boros remains at the  Red Keep . He guards Tommen when Ser  Kevan Lannister  has dinner with Cersei and the king. Kevan thinks Boros feeble, and that tasting food is possibly the only thing he is good for. At the dinner, Boros appears heavier and in poor health. He has a difficult time standing for the duration of the meal, and has to lean on a wall for support. [20] 
 
 Quotes by Boros 
 Your Grace, the sight of our white cloaks might enrage the mob. [8] 
  – Boros to  Cersei Lannister 
 Quotes about Boros 
 Ser Boros was the worst of the  Kingsguard , an ugly man with a foul temper, all scowls and jowls. [13] 
  – thoughts of  Sansa Stark 
 
 
 That one is nothing to fear, girl. Paint stripes on a toad, he does not become a tiger. [13] 
  –  Sandor Clegane  to  Sansa Stark 
 
 
 Blount is a blustering coward. [10] 
  –  Tyrion Lannister  to  Varys 
 
 
 The man is craven, and a good thing. Though fat, aging, and never more than ordinary, Ser Boros could still hack him into bloody pieces. But Boros does not know that, and neither must the rest they feared the man I was; the man I am they'd pity. [4] 
  – thoughts of  Jaime Lannister  after losing his sword hand
 
 
 Boros is a craven. [18] 
  –  Margaery Tyrell  to  Cersei Lannister 
 
 
 Boros the Belly? He's what, forty? Fifty? Half-drunk half the time, fat even when he's sober. If he ever had a taste for battle, he's lost it. [19] 
  –  Osmund Kettleblack  to  Cersei Lannister 
 
 
 Ser Boros tasted every dish that was set before  the king . A humiliating duty for a  knight  of the  Kingsguard , but perhaps all Blount was capable of these days ... [20] 
  – thoughts of  Kevan Lannister
