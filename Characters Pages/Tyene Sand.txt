Tyene spent her youth at the Water Gardens with her cousin, Princess Arianne Martell , and the two grew as close as sisters, learning to read, ride, and dance together. They have shared meals, jewelry, beds, and onetime a flagon of wine stolen by Arianne. The two would have lost their virginity together to Andrey Dalt as well, but he was premature in the encounter. [4]  Arianne once crossed the Mander with three of the Sand Snakes to visit Tyene's mother. [5] Tyene and Arianne once fled Sunspear to try to marry Arianne to Willas Tyrell at Highgarden , but they were caught by Tyene's father, Oberyn Martell , at Vaith . [4] Oberyn also once brought Tyene with Arianne and Sarella Sand to Shandystone , where he showed Tyene how to milk vipers for their venom. [5]  Doran Martell , Prince of Dorne , kept a marriage pact hidden from Arianne because he feared his daughter would not have kept it a secret from Tyene, who would then have informed her sisters, Obara and Nymeria .

[2]  Nymeria Sand wants Tyene to aid her in assassinating Lord Tywin Lannister , Queen Regent Cersei Lannister , Ser Jaime Lannister , and King Tommen I Baratheon . Tyene instead wants to crown Tommen's sister, Princess Myrcella Baratheon , as queen, and if the Lannisters and Tyrells invade Dorne they would then be slain in the Dornish mountains and sands. After Doran states that he will think about her proposal, Tyene asks for his blessing. After he lays his hand on her head, Maester Caleotte searches for scratches and puncture marks, demonstrating a fear of her knowledge of poisons . [2]  Doran has Areo Hotah detain Tyene and her sisters as a gesture of good will towards Tommen's court. [2] Tyene, Nym, and Obara are detained in the Spear Tower of Sunspear, as is Princess Arianne Martell after her own plot to crown Myrcella is foiled by Areo.

She refuses to drink when Ricasso raises a toast to King Tommen. [3]  Doran tasks Nymeria with returning Mycella to King's Landing and joining the small council . Tyene is to accompany her sister and, disguised as a septa , gain the confidence of the High Sparrow . [3]   Quotes by Tyene   Tyene Sand by Gabrielle Portal © Fantasy Flight Games  Forgive me if I gave offense; my heart is broken all to pieces. [2]  - Tyene to Doran Martell    Sisters, truly, I know the poison Father used. If his spear so much as broke the Mountain's skin, Clegane is dead, I do not care how big he was. Doubt your little sister if you like, but never doubt our sire. [3]  - Tyene to Obara Sand and Nymeria Sand    Doran : The Swords and the Stars have been re-formed, and this new High Septon is not the puppet that the others were. Try and get close to him.  Tyene : Why not? White suits my coloring. I look so ... pure. [3]  - Doran Martell and Tyene Quotes about Tyene  Lady Tyene's voice was gentle, and she looked as sweet as summer strawberries. Her mother had been a septa , and Tyene had an air of almost otherworldy innocence about her. [2]  - thoughts of Areo Hotah    I have never been as fearless as my cousins , for I was made with weaker seed, but Tyene and I are of an age and have been close as sisters since we were little girls. We have no secrets between us. If she can be imprisoned, so can I, and for the same cause ... this of Myrcella . [6]  - Arianne Martell to Arys Oakheart    Her hands are dangerous. [4]  - thoughts of Arianne Martell    Hotah studied each of them in turn. Obara , rusted nails and boiled leather, with her angry, close-set eyes and rat-brown hair. Nymeria , languid, elegant, olive-skinned, her long black braid bound up in red-gold wire. Tyene, blue-eyed and blond, a child-woman with her soft hands and little giggles.
