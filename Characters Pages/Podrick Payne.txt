He has a stye beneath one eye. [4] He is very quiet. [3]   History  Podrick was born a member of a lesser branch of House Payne . His father was a squire to richer cousins and his mother was a chandler's daughter. His father died in the Greyjoy Rebellion and his mother abandoned him when he was four years old and ran away with one of the cousins his father had squired for. He ended up with Ser Cedric Payne who took care of him, although he might have treated him more like a servant than a relative. Ser Cedric took him along to tend his horse and clean his mail, when Lord Tywin Lannister called his banners at the start of the War of the Five Kings . Ser Cedric died in the fighting in the Riverlands . [5]  Podrick, alone in the army, attached himself to the hedge knight Ser Lorimer , who was part of Lord Leo Lefford 's troops and charged with protecting the baggage train. Ser Lorimer stole a ham from Lord Tywin's personal stores and was hanged for it, but Podrick, who had shared the ham, was spared due to his family's name. Ser Kevan Lannister took charge of him.

Whenever she speaks to him, he turns the most alarming shade of red.

[4]  Brienne first notices Podrick from a distance in Rosby , riding on his horse , [10] then again outside of Duskendale, later bumping into him on a street of the town, knocking him over. She remembers seeing him earlier and his behavior seems suspicious. She notices him again on the road to Maidenpool and realizes that he has been stalking her at least since Rosby. She confronts him and finds out that Podrick has been following her in hopes of finding Sansa, who in turn might know the whereabouts of Tyrion. [4] Brienne agrees to bring Podrick with her and along the way helps him to improve his swordsmanship.

Podrick is judged guilty for being allied with House Lannister as well, and is sentenced to die alongside Brienne. However, when the brotherhood begins to hang them, Brienne of Tarth screams "sword" in an attempt to save Podrick from the noose.
