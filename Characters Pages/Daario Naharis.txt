His eyes are blue and his curly hair is dyed blue. His mustachios are painted gold and he has a large, curving nose. He is lithe, smooth skinned, has a golden tooth and dresses in loud colors and finery. He wears a Dothraki  arakh on his left hip and a Myrish stiletto on his right hip. Their hilts are a matched pair of naked women made in gold. [2]  Daario is a capable warrior and like most sellswords is fickle, faithless and brutal. He is also quick to anger and reckless. He seems to have some genuine affection for Daenerys Targaryen .  Recent Events   Daario with the heads of Prendahl and Sallor - by Amok ©  A Storm of Swords   Daario Naharis, Captain of the Stormcrows and paramour of Daenerys Targaryen - by Sardag ©  Daario is part of the Stormcrows when they take on a contract to defend Yunkai from the forces of Daenerys Targaryen . Daario is one of the captains of the Stormcrows who attend the parley with Daenerys. She offers the captains gold and plunder if the Stormcrows come over to her side, but is rebuffed by Prendahl na Ghezn , one of the other captains. The Stormcrows are a company of freedmen, and therefore the question of breaking the contract with Yunkai would have to be put to each man. While that debate is going on in the camp, Daario, won over by Daenerys, kills Prendahl and his fellow captain, Sallor the Bald , and brings the Stormcrows over to Daenerys. [2]   A Dance with Dragons  Daenerys sends Daario as an ambassador to the Lhazareen with the mission of reopening the land trade routes between Lhazar and Meereen . [3] Daenerys and he eventually become lovers. [4] Daario makes several suggestions on how to achieve peace, such as going ahead with the wedding of Dany to Hizdahr zo Loraq and then at the wedding feast, his sellswords slay all the Meereenese nobles whose loyalty to Dany is dubious. This plan—quite similar to the Red Wedding —horrifies Daenerys and she refuses to go along with it. Daario becomes bad tempered when Dany weds Hizdahr and he leaves her presence. [5] He, along with Jhogo , Captain Groleo , and several others, are given as hostages to Yunkai to vouchsafe for Daenerys's good intentions for peace. [5] When Daenerys disappears on dragonback, [6] the Yunkai'i refuse to release the hostages until the other two dragons are executed. As Daario remains a prisoner of the Yunkai'i, command of the Stormcrows passes to the Widower and Jokin . [7]   Quotes by Daario  I count no day as lived unless I have loved a woman, slain a foeman, and eaten a fine meal... [2]     My sword is yours. My life is yours. My love is yours. My blood, my body, my songs, you own them all. I live and die at your command, fair queen. [2]  – Daario, to Daenerys Targaryen    I trust all my men. Just as far as I can spit. [8]     Better the butcher than the meat. All kings are butchers. Are queens so different? [8]  – Daario, to Daenerys Targaryen    Daenerys : You boasted that you'd had a hundred women. Daario : A hundred? I lied, sweet queen. It was a thousand. But never once a dragon . [4]  – Daario, to Daenerys Targaryen    Daenerys : Where are you going? Daario : Out into your city, to drink a keg or two and pick a quarrel. It has been too long since I've killed a man. Might be I should seek out your betrothed . [9]  – Daario, to Daenerys Targaryen  Quotes about Daario  He has a sellsword 's conscience, That is to say, none at all.  - Daenerys Targaryen 's thoughts   Daario... She loves Daario. He had seen it in her eyes when she looked at him, heard it in her voice when she spoke of him. [10]  – Barristan Selmy    Her love for Daario is poison. A slower poison than the locusts , but in the end as deadly.
