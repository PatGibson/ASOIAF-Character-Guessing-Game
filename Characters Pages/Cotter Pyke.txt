[14]  - Cotter to Jon Snow  Quotes about Cotter  Those look like Eastwatch men. Sailors on horses. Cotter Pyke always had more guts than sense. [6]  - Mance Rayder to Jon Snow    Samwell, it is not my habit to speak unkindly of my brothers, but let us be frank ... the ironborn are a race of pirates and thieves, and Cotter Pyke was raping and murdering when he was still half a boy. [1]  - Denys Mallister to Samwell Tarly    We are done with Eastwatch . We did not like it there. A queen should be mistress beneath her own roof.
