 Appearance 
 See also:  Images of Cressen 
 At nearly eighty years old, Cressen is frail with a bad hip, causing him to have trouble walking. He has wrinkly, thin skin and trembling hands. [2] 
 
 History 
 Maester Cressen used to be maester of  Storm's End . When Lord  Steffon Baratheon  and his wife  Cassana Estermont  died in a shipwreck, Cressen more or less raised the Baratheon children. Stannis was his favourite as he needed Cressen more because he lacked the charm of his brothers. Cressen came to regard Stannis as the son he never had.
 During the  Siege of Storm's End  some men of the garrison tried to open the gate. Stannis had wanted to place them on the catapults and send them to the enemy, but Cressen advised against it. He pointed out that they did not have much food and that hunger might force them to eat the prisoners.
 When  Robert Baratheon  gave Dragonstone to Stannis, Maester Cressen followed him to the ancient stronghold. As a maester is sworn to advise and serve a specific castle, regardless of changes in control of that holding, this is very uncommon.
 Some time before the  War of the Five Kings  Stannis asked for the  Citadel  to send him a replacement for Cressen as he began to age, so they sent  Pylos . [2] 
 It is implied that Maester Cressen worked with  Walgrave  in the past. [3] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Clash of Kings 
 After  Stannis  declares himself king he unsuccessfully sends messengers to gather support for his claim, with only the vassals of  Dragonstone  supporting him. The lords of the  stormlands  support Stannis's younger brother,  Renly Baratheon , who has claimed the throne as well.
 Maester Cressen advises Stannis to ally with the  Starks  and the  Arryns . Stannis says that those crowning  Robb Stark  are committing treason. Stannis's queen, Lady  Selyse , urges Stannis to rely solely on  R'hllor  and says that according to  Melisandre , Renly will die soon. Cressen thinks that Selyse suggested that Stannis have Renly assassinated and is shocked because Stannis seems to listen to this advice. He blames Melisandre for this and plans to kill her.
 At dinner Cressen  poisons  Melisandre's wine. She seems to sense this and suggests to Cressen to throw the wine away, but Cressen insists that they share the cup. Melisandre drinks the majority of the wine, but is unaffected. Cressen drinks the final sip, and dies. [2] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
 Aboard the  Bountiful Harvest   Davos Seaworth  wonders if Melisandre can be killed by mortal weapons. He is not certain she can be, as he had seen old Maester Cressen slip  poison  into Melisandre's wine with his own eyes and when they both drank from the poisoned cup it was the maester who had died, not the red priestess.  [4] 
 Climbing up the narrow twisted steps of Sea Dragon Tower  Davos Seaworth  is reminded of Cressen. He finds himself missing the old man and he thinks Stannis must as well. He thinks that the old man had been with Stannis so long, until he ran afoul of Melisandre, and died for it.
 When meeting with his the small group of  king's men , just before  Edric Storm  is secretly shipped away, Davos reminds them that when Maester Cressen attempted to kill  Melisandre  she knew at once. [5] 
 
 Quotes 
 When a maester donned his collar, he put aside the hope of children, yet Cressen had oft felt a father nontheless. Robert, Stannis, Renly: three sons he had raised after the angry sea claimed Lord Steffon.
