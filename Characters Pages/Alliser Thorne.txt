[7]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones   Alliser Thorne - by Brittmartin ©  As master-at-arms responsible for training new recruits, Ser Alliser gives Jon Snow the mocking nickname "Lord Snow". His disdain turns into hatred when Jon replies to one of his mockeries, provoking the hilarity of the whole common room of Castle Black . [2] Having absolutely no humor, he takes the mockeries of Tyrion Lannister poorly when Tyrion is invited to the table of the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch , Jeor Mormont , during his visit to the Wall . Alliser is, however, so delighted at Jon's appointment to the stewards that Jon thinks he is behind it. Alliser never misses an occasion to provoke the young bastard. The evening Jon learns of the imprisonment of his father, Lord Eddard Stark , in King's Landing for treason, Alliser's jeers anger Jon, who tries to attack him with a knife, before being stopped and put under arrest. This mutual hostility, and the master-at-arms' old friends who are well-placed at court, lead the Lord Commander to send Alliser to the new king, Joffrey I Baratheon , with the mission to acquire reinforcements for the Night's Watch. Ser Endrew Tarth takes Alliser's place as the master-at-arms of Castle Black . [8]   A Clash of Kings  After a long travel, Ser Alliser arrives in King's Landing . In the Red Keep , he asks for an audience with Tyrion Lannister, the acting Hand of the King . Tyrion, remembering his dislike for Alliser, has Bronn find poor quarters for the visitor. [3] Alliser appears before the throne, only to be mocked by Tyrion. However, Tyrion allows for word to be put out in King's Landing that the Night's Watch is in need of men.

He returns to Castle Black during the resistance to Mance Rayder 's wildlings siege and becomes one of Janos Slynt 's followers. [4] During the choosing for a new Lord Commander, Alliser comes in sixth in voting on the first day and loses votes on the second day. He withdraws his name and decides to support Janos. [9] Jon Snow is chosen as the new Lord Commander, however.  A Dance with Dragons  When Janos refuses to obey orders, Jon personally executes him. Ser Alliser is present when the sentence is given but does not interfere, much to Jon's disappointment. [5] Alliser opposes Jon's decision to let wildlings pass south of the Wall. [10]  Jon later orders Alliser to accompany Dywen and another seasoned ranger  beyond the Wall . Alliser is angry, but accepts the mission, not wanting to give Jon cause to execute him as well. He then states that he will return from the ranging, one way or the other. [11]
