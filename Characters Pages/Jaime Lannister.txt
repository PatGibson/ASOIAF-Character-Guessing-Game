 Appearance and Character

 As young children, Jaime and his sister  Cersei  looked so much alike, that not even their father was able to keep them apart. [9]  Jaime grew into a tall, handsome man, with curled hair the color of beaten gold. [4] [10] [11]  He has flashing cat-green [12]  eyes, and a smile that cuts like a knife. [1] [13]   Jon Snow  thinks to himself that Jaime is "what a king should look like", [1]  and  Bran Stark  feels that Jaime looks like "more like the  knights  in the stories". [14]  He is muscular and extremely strong, musing at one point that he could only think of a few men in the  Seven Kingdoms  stronger than him. [15] 
 As a  Kingsguard  knight, Jaime wears a white armor and a white cloak. [16]  On occasion he wears golden armor decorated with the  Lannister  lion, with gilded longsword and ornate lion's helmet. [17] [18] [19]  He slew the Mad King  Aerys II Targaryen  while wearing his white cloak over his golden armor. [20]  Jaime alternatively wears a crimson silk tunic embroidered with a golden lion, along with black boots and a black cloak. [1]  He also wears crimson cloaks [21]  and a leather jack. [22]  Jaime wields a lance of  golden wood . [18] 
 Jaime is a born warrior, with little interest in politics and court intrigue. He takes few things seriously. [13]  By his own admission, Jaime only feels truly alive when fighting or making love. [9]  He comes across as arrogant, amoral, and dishonorable. [23] [24] [7] [22]  Because of the death of King Aerys, Jaime has earned such a bad reputation that everything he says is usually cast in the worst possible light. [25] 
 Jaime is rash, headstrong, and angers quickly. [26] [27]  He is known to have little patience, [21]  and he worries about the consequences of his actions only after committing the act. [28]  A great [29]  and especially skilled warrior, [30]  Jaime inspires loyalty in his men. [31] [32]  He is bold [33]  and does not fear death. [34]  According to  Catelyn Stark , Jaime is an experienced battle commander. [35] 
 
 History 
 Early life 
 Jaime was born in  266 AC , as the first-born son of Ser  Tywin Lannister , the heir to  Casterly Rock , and his wife, Lady  Joanna . [4] [5]  Jaime was born shortly after his twin sister  Cersei , while holding her foot. [36] [37]  King  Aerys II Targaryen  sent both Jaime and Cersei their weight in gold as a nameday gift, and commanded Lord Tywin to bring the children to court when they were old enough to travel. [4]  It is currently unknown whether this visit to King's Landing actually occurred, as the royal court came to Casterly Rock following the death of  Tytos Lannister  in  276 AC . [4]  Jaime and Cersei did visit King's Landing in  272 AC , when their mother brought them from  Casterly Rock  for the  Anniversary Tourney  held to celebrate the tenth year of King Aerys's reign. [4] 
 Jaime and Cersei were inseparable in their early childhood. [38]  As children, they played together in bowels of Casterly Rock, where the caged lions of his late grandfather,  Tytos , were kept. Jaime and Cersei would dare each other to climb into the cage. [39]  Cersei and Jaime slept together in the same bed when they were very young, [38]  and even went as far as to experiment together in a sexual manner at a young age. [36]  During one of these encounters, they were caught by a servant who informed their mother. Jaime's bedchamber was immediately moved to the other side of the castle, whilst a guard was placed near Cersei's bedchamber. The twins were told never to do anything like that ever again, as Joanna would otherwise be forced to tell their father. [24] 
 Jaime's mother died not long thereafter, [24]  in  273 AC , [4] [5]  when giving birth to Jaime's younger brother,  Tyrion . [1]  Even though Tyrion is a malformed  dwarf , and both his father and sister despise the young Lannister, Jaime developed an affection for his youngest sibling, and treated him with kindness and respect. [13] [40]  Shortly after Joanna's death, the  Princess of Dorne  visited Casterly Rock with her two youngest children,  Elia  and  Oberyn Martell . When she eventually proposed a betrothal between Elia and Jaime, she was refused. [41] 
 In  276 AC , when Jaime was ten years old, Lord Tywin hosted a  tourney  to celebrate the birth of young Prince  Viserys Targaryen . During  this tourney , Tywin suggested to King Aerys that Jaime could squire for  Rhaegar Targaryen ,  Prince of Dragonstone , but Aerys refused and named the sons of other lords to the position instead. [4] 
 Jaime went to  Crakehall  at the age of eleven, and spent four years squiring for Lord  Sumner Crakehall , [15]  alongside  Merrett Frey . [42] [43]  He occasionally visited Casterly Rock during this time, [44]  and raged when, in  278 AC , his sister Cersei was brought to  King's Landing  by their father. [45]  At the age of thirteen, while still a squire, Jaime won his first tourney melee. [15] [43]  Whilst a squire to Lord Sumner, Jaime was sent to  Riverrun , [46]  as Lord Tywin and Lord  Hoster Tully  had been considering betrothing Jaime to Hoster's younger daughter,  Lysa . [47]  According to Sumner, the message Jaime was to bring to Hoster could not be entrusted to a raven. [46]  He spent a fortnight at Riverrun, being seated next to Lysa during meals. Jaime ignored her, however, being more interested the stories of Hoster's younger brother, Ser  Brynden , a famous warrior who had fought in the  War of the Ninepenny Kings , and whom Jaime asked for stories about the war. [46] 
 
 Raised to Knighthood and to the Kingsguard

 At the age of fifteen, Jaime participated in the campaign against the  Kingswood Brotherhood , during which he saved Lord  Sumner Crakehall  from  Big Belly Ben  and crossed swords with the psychotic  Smiling Knight . After the brotherhood had been defeated, Jaime was  knighted  on the battlefield by Ser  Arthur Dayne , a member of the  Kingsguard  of King  Aerys II Targaryen . [15] 
 Now a knight, Jaime was to return to  Casterly Rock . He decided to stop in  King's Landing  on route, to visit his sister, from whom he had been separated for years. There, Cersei informed him that their father, Lord  Tywin Lannister , intended to betroth him to  Lysa Tully , and had gone as far as inviting Lord Hoster to King's Landing, to discuss the dower. Cersei suggested that Jaime become a member of the  Kingsguard  instead, replacing the recently-deceased Ser  Harlan Grandison . Though this would require Jaime to give up his claim to Casterly Rock and his position as Tywin's heir, it would allow him to be close to Cersei and free himself of the unwanted marriage to Lysa. After a night of passionate sex, he gave his consent to Cersei's plan. While the siblings expected Tywin to oppose it, Cersei claimed he could not openly object. She promised to do the rest, and a month later, Jaime received news at Casterly Rock that he had been chosen for the Kingsguard, and was to present himself to the king during the grand  tourney at Harrenhal , where he would say his vows and don his cloak. [15]  Jaime's and Cersei's plan did not entirely work as expected. Their father, furious about the king's decision, pleaded illness and resigned his position as  Hand of the King . He returned to Casterly Rock, taking Cersei with him, which separated the siblings once more. [4] [15] 
 Jaime was raised to the Kingsguard by its  Lord Commander , Ser  Gerold Hightower , in a ceremony at  Harrenhal  in  281 AC , making him the youngest knight ever to be raised to the order. [6] [3] [48]  That night, however, King Aerys soured the honor by sending him back to King's Landing to guard Queen  Rhaella  and Prince  Viserys , depriving Jaime of the chance to participate in Lord  Walter Whent 's tourney. It was that moment during which Jaime realized that the king had only chosen him for the Kingsguard to slight Lord Tywin, of whom Aerys was insanely jealous, and to rob him of his heir. [3]  Jaime left for King's Landing at once. When a  mystery knight  appeared at the tourney, King Aerys became convinced that it was Jaime, who had defied his orders and secretly returned. [49]  However, the mystery knight disappeared, [48] [49]  and nothing further came of the king's suspicions.
 By being raised to the Kingsguard, Jaime gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. [32]  Nonetheless, Tywin continued to regard him as his true heir, and was always angry to see Jaime dressed all in white, instead of the red and gold of  House Lannister . [39] 
 
 Serving in the Kingsguard 
   Ser Jaime Lannister, by John Picacio ©. 
 Raised to the knightly order in  281 AC , Jaime served in King  Aerys II Targaryen 's Kingsguard for two years. Jaime grew more and more disillusioned, witnessing the Mad King's growing insanity and tendency for burning men alive. [47]  In  282 AC , Jaime witnessed the executions of  Brandon  and Lord  Rickard Stark , standing at the foot of the  Iron Throne  as the two  Starks  were dying. Jaime coped by "going away inside", focusing on thoughts of Cersei instead of the events occurring in front of him. Afterwards, he was reminded by his Lord Commander, Ser  Gerold Hightower , that he swore a vow to guard the king, not to judge him. [12]  Jaime would later advise others to "go away inside" as a way to deal with a harsh reality and making an appalling task tolerable. [25] [2] 
 
 Robert's Rebellion 
 Following the deaths of Brandon and Rickard Stark, Lord  Jon Arryn  refused to obey  Aerys II Targaryen 's order to send the heads of  Eddard Stark  and  Robert Baratheon , starting a war that would become known as  Robert's Rebellion . [50] [51]  After the  Battle of the Bells , it became apparent to Aerys that Robert was a serious threat to Targaryen rule. He devised a  plot  with the help of his chief  pyromancers , which involved the placement of caches of  wildfire  all throughout the city. The plan was to burn the entire city to the ground rather than lose it to Robert. His new Hand, Lord  Qarlton Chelsted , who had been elevated to the position after the exile of the previous Hand, Lord  Jon Connington , following the Battle of the Bells, eventually confronted Aerys about his plan. Failing to convince Aerys to give up his plan, Chelsted resigned the office, flinging his chain of office to the floor. For that, Aerys burned him alive. As Aerys did not trust his newest addition to the  Kingsguard , Jaime was kept close by, and therefore heard and saw it all. [7] 
 Aerys grew aroused by burning people, and the night Chelsted was burned, Aerys visited the chambers of his wife. Jaime and his sworn brother, Ser  Jonothor Darry , stood guard outside Queen Rhaella's bedchamber while Aerys raped her, listening to her cries. When Jaime, feeling conflicted, eventually commented to Jonothor that they were sworn to protect the queen as well, Jon replied, "but not from him." [6] 
 Shortly after, Prince  Rhaegar Targaryen  left the  Red Keep  to face the rebels on the  Trident . The day the prince left, Jaime begged Rhaegar to take him along, suggesting one of the other Kingsguard knights could remain at the king's side instead. Rhaegar refused the suggestion, admitting that King Aerys wanted to keep Jaime close as a hostage against his father, Lord Tywin. Rhaegar promised an angry and disappointed Jaime that changes would be made when he returned from the battlefield, [2]  and charged Jaime with keeping his wife,  Elia Martell , and their children safe. [52] 
 
 Kingslayer 
   Jaime slays King  Aerys II Targaryen , by Michael Komarck ©. 
 While a rebel army led by Lord  Eddard Stark  raced towards  King's Landing  after Rhaegar's death at the  Trident , Lord  Tywin Lannister  appeared first at the gates of the capital with twelve thousand men. His main concerns were that King  Aerys II Targaryen  would be capable of killing Jaime out of spite, as well as that Jaime himself could do something rash. Though Lord  Varys , the  master of whisperers , counseled Aerys against opening the gates, the king listened to Grand Maester  Pycelle , who told him that his old Hand, Tywin, had come to his defense. As such, the city gates were opened to Tywin and his army, but once inside, Tywin betrayed Aerys and began the  Sack of King's Landing . [7] 
 As the sole Kingsguard remaining in King's Landing, the defense of the  Red Keep  became Jaime's responsibility. Knowing that he did not stand a chance to defend the castle, he sent a messenger to the king, asking for leave to make terms with the attackers. The messenger came back with the Aerys's order that Jaime should bring him Lord Tywin's head, to prove that he was no traitor. The messenger also informed him that  Rossart  was with the king, leading Jaime to believe that Aerys was about to command  the destruction of the city . [7] 
 Jaime killed Rossart, who was dressed as a common soldier and hurrying to a postern gate. When the king in the throne room saw the blood on Jaime's sword, he demanded to know whether it was Tywin's, renewing his command that Jaime should bring him his father's head, otherwise Jaime would burn with all the other traitors. When Jaime answered that it was Rossart's blood, the frightened Aerys ran towards the  Iron Throne . Jaime hauled him off the steps, and killed his king with a single slash across the throat, thereby preventing him from giving the command to burn the city to some other pyromancer. [15] [7] 
 
   Jaime sits on the  Iron Throne , by Michael Komarck ©. 
 Lord Tywin's men, led by Ser  Elys Westerling  and Lord  Roland Crakehall , burst into the throne room in time to see that Jaime had killed the king, forestalling any chance for Jaime to steal away and let someone else claim responsibility. Jaime told them to advise all who were still fighting that the king was dead and to spare anyone who yielded. Lord Crakehall then asked whether a new king should be proclaimed as well, indicating that it could be Lord Tywin or  Robert Baratheon  or that even a new Targaryen king could be proclaimed. Jaime mused on the possibility of choosing  Viserys  or Rhaegar's son,  Aegon , as the new king with Tywin as his Hand, but, realising that both boys shared the same blood as Aerys and thus the same propensity for  madness , Jaime declared to Lord Crakehall that it was all the same to him. He then seated himself on the Iron Throne, waiting to see who would come to claim it. He was found sitting there with his golden sword across his legs when Lord Stark rode into the hall with his men to claim the throne for Robert. Jaime gave up the throne to Eddard, proclaiming it to be an uncomfortable seat. [20] [15] 
 In the following days, Jaime secretly hunted down and killed the two other pyromancers involved in Aerys's wildfire plot,  Belis  and  Garigus . [7]  Although Eddard urged Robert to strip Jaime of the white cloak, arguing that he should at least be made to join the  Night's Watch , Robert listened to  Jon Arryn  instead. Jaime was pardoned by King Robert I, together with Varys and Pycelle, [12]  and continued to serve in the Kingsguard along with Ser  Barristan Selmy . [53]  Jaime was present at Robert's coronation feast, where Robert joked about the fact that Jaime was already being called "Kingslayer". [7]  He is known to himself, [54]  other Kingsguard, [55]  and as far as Winterfell [1]  and Essos [56]  by the nickname. Though reviled by the realm for his betrayal, Jaime considers the slaying of Aerys to be his finest act. [12]  His true motivation for killing King Aerys remains unknown to the masses.
 
 Reign of Robert I Baratheon 
 Jaime was part of the honor guard that brought  Cersei  to  King's Landing  for her wedding to  Robert I Baratheon . Cersei and Robert were married in  284 AC , [57]  with Jaime present. [45]  He won the tourney held to celebrate the wedding. [54]  Jaime and Cersei had sex on the morning of Cersei's wedding, [58]  and continued their illicit relationship after Cersei's wedding. Cersei refused to join her new husband on his hunting trips, as to be able to spend time with Jaime. [59]  Jaime accompanied Robert and Cersei to  Greenstone , when Robert went to visit his mother's family. Jaime dubbed the castle "Greenshit" when he first saw it, and convinced Cersei to do the same. They spent a fortnight with the  Estermonts . During one of those nights, Jaime followed Robert on Cersei's request, to confirm her suspicion that Robert was sleeping with his cousin. Jaime and Cersei slept together that night, and Cersei likes to believe that their eldest son,  Joffrey , was conceived that night. [60] 
 Jaime and Cersei would have three children: Joffrey, born in  286 AC ,  Myrcella , born in  289 AC , and  Tommen , born in  290 AC . [61]  Though believed by the realm to be Robert's children, Jaime is the father of all three, and was present for at least one of the births. [62]  While Cersei also became pregnant by Robert once, she had Jaime find a woman to cleanse her. [36] 
 One day, Jaime and his brother  Tyrion , thirteen years of age at the time, while on a nightly ride from  Lannisport  to  Casterly Rock , came upon a fourteen year old girl called  Tysha , who was being followed by outlaws. While Jaime pursued the men, Tyrion took the girl to an inn. The two ended up sleeping together, the first time for both. Tyrion fell in love and secretly married the orphaned daughter of a crofter. After a fortnight, however, Lord  Tywin  learned about the marriage. He instructed Jaime to lie to Tyrion, and claim that he had staged the whole affair, including the outlaws, because he had thought his brother finally needed a woman. Jaime was further ordered to tell Tyrion that Tysha was, in fact, a whore, for whom Jaime had paid double because she was still a maiden. Lord Tywin advised Jaime that all Tysha wanted was the gold of the  Lannisters , which made her no better than a whore, so it would not even be a lie, predicting that Tyrion would thank his brother later in life. Jaime did as bid. [63] [64]  It is currently unknown whether Jaime is aware of the punishment Tysha received from Tywin. However, the entire experience traumatized Tyrion, causing him to believe that no woman could ever love him for who he truly was. [53] [65] [66]  Jaime kept the truth about Tysha from Tyrion, and later considered his role in ending his brother's marriage the sole instance when he was unkind to Tyrion. [67] 
 Following  Greyjoy's Rebellion  in  289 AC , Jaime took part in the  tourney at Lannisport , where he broke nine lances against Ser  Jorah Mormont . Robert eventually rewarded the victory to Jorah. [68]  In  296 AC , Jaime gave Tyrion a mare for his brother's twenty-third birthday. [69]  Jaime has visited  Oldtown  at some point in his life. [54]

 A Game of Thrones 
 After the death of their foster-father, Lord  Jon Arryn , King  Robert I Baratheon  travels north to visit Lord  Eddard Stark  at  Winterfell  and persuade him to become Jon's successor as  Hand of the King . Jaime is chosen by Robert as Jon's successor as  Warden of the East  rather than Jon's son, young Lord  Robert Arryn , who would have been the traditional appointee. [20]  The king is accompanied by much of the court, among them Jaime, Queen  Cersei Lannister , and their brother  Tyrion . [10] 
 While at Winterfell, Jaime and Cersei attend the feast given by  House Stark . Later, they are caught having sex in the  First Keep  by  Bran Stark . Bran is shocked and almost falls from the tower. Jaime pulls him up and then throws him out of the window, intending to kill him to keep the affair a secret. [14]  Bran survives but falls into a coma. [13] 
 Ned accepts Robert's invitation to be Hand, and in  King's Landing  he begins investigating the death of Jon Arryn. [70] [71]  In this investigation, he discovers Jaime and Cersei's secret relationship by piecing together the fact that every time in history a Lannister wedded a  Baratheon , they produced raven-haired children. Instead Cersei's children  Joffrey ,  Myrcella , and  Tommen  are all fair-haired. [36] 
 During the  Hand's tourney , Jaime wears his golden armor beneath his white cloak. [17]  He defeats Ser  Andar Royce , Lord  Bryce Caron , and Ser  Barristan Selmy , [17]  but is unhorsed by  Sandor Clegane . [18] 
 Meanwhile,  Catelyn Stark , Lady of Winterfell, captures Jaime's brother Tyrion on suspicion of involvement in a botched  assassination attempt  on Bran Stark. [72]  In retaliation for Tyrion's capture, but ostensibly to create an uprising, Jaime breaks Kingsguard neutrality by leading Lannister men in an attack on Ned and  his guards  in the streets of King's Landing, leading to numerous deaths on both sides. [19]  Jaime then flees from King's Landing and joins his father, Lord  Tywin Lannister , afield with his army to threaten Catelyn's home in the  riverlands . [73]  Tywin appoints Jaime to command half the host of the  westerlands . Robert dies after being gored in the  kingswood  by a boar, and the king is succeeded by Joffrey I Baratheon, who is actually Jaime's son. [74] 
 
   Jaime is  captured  in the  Whispering Wood , by Mathia Arkoniel ©. 
 Jaime's army marches against the river lords, smashing Lord  Vance  and Lord  Piper  in a  battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth . [35]  Jaime then defeats Ser  Edmure Tully 's host in a  battle under the walls of Riverrun , capturing the heir of  House Tully . [75]  Jaime establishes three camps at  Riverrun  and besieges the castle. [76]  Meanwhile, Joffrey's  small council  dismisses Ser  Barristan Selmy  as  Lord Commander of the Kingsguard  and names Jaime as his replacement. [55] 
 Robb Stark 's  northern  army steals a surprise march on Jaime, intent on relieving Riverrun. Ser  Brynden Tully  raids Jaime's camps to draw him north of Riverrun, and Robb ambushes the Lannister detachment in the  Whispering Wood . Seeing the battle is lost, Jaime fights bravely to try and cut down Robb, managing to kill  Daryn Hornwood ,  Eddard Karstark , and  Torrhen Karstark  before he is captured. [21]  Afterwards, the Stark-Tully forces are able to best Jaime's leaderless troops in the  Battle of the Camps , [76]  and Jaime is imprisoned in Riverrun. Ser  Stevron Frey  proposes ransoming Jaime back to Tywin, but the suggestion is opposed by northmen. [76] 
 
 A Clash of Kings 
 When Lord Tywin appoints Tyrion as acting  Hand of the King , Tyrion promises to help free Jaime to gain Cersei's support. [53]   Tyrion's plan  to free Jaime with  disguised soldiers  is unsuccessful. For breaking his word not to try to escape, Edmure transfers him to the dungeons. He is kept chained and malnourished. [77]  Unbeknownst to Jaime, Cersei takes their cousin  Lancel Lannister  as her lover. [78] 
 While the  War of the Five Kings  rages around him, Jaime continues to be imprisoned in Riverrun. Negotiations for his release lead to nothing. Tyrion swears in open court to trade  Sansa  and  Arya Stark  for the return of his brother. However, Robb Stark, now  King in the North , declines this exchange. Distraught at the news of the  alleged deaths  of her sons  Bran  and  Rickon Stark , Catelyn interrogates Jaime. [12]  He now has a shaggy beard, not having been allowed a razor, and his hair is unwashed and in tangles. Jaime's power and beauty are still apparent, however, and he resembles a magnificent yellow beast. [12] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
   Jaime after losing his hand, by mustamirri ©. 
 In return for Lady  Lysa Arryn  marrying Lord  Petyr Baelish  and returning to the king's peace, Lord  Tywin Lannister  decides to return the title of  Warden of the East  to Lord  Robert Arryn  from Jaime. [79] 
 Catelyn Stark , acting on her own, releases Jaime from  Riverrun  in an attempt to make an unofficial exchange for her daughters. Along with his cousin and fellow captive Ser  Cleos Frey , and Catelyn's sworn sword,  Brienne of Tarth , Jaime begins the journey towards  King's Landing . Jaime shaves his head so his golden locks will not be recognized, although he keeps the beard. He thinks he looks five years older, with a paler and thinner face and hollows under his eyes. [34] 
 The trio evade recapture by Ser  Robin Ryger  and his party from Riverrun, through Brienne's tactic of dropping boulders onto the chasing boat. [34]  Jaime approves of Brienne's decision to ignore the travel advice of the " innkeeper " at the  Inn of the Kneeling Man , suspecting he is in league with bandits. [15]  Later, on the road between  Maidenpool  and  Duskendale , Cleos is killed when the group is ambushed by bandits. Afterward, Jaime takes his sword and briefly duels Brienne in an attempt to escape, but both of them are caught unawares and captured by the  Brave Companions  led by  Vargo Hoat , who have betrayed Lord Tywin and shifted allegiance to Robb Stark. [24] 
 Vargo suspects that his superior, Lord  Roose Bolton , is thinking about going over to the Lannisters after their victory over  Stannis Baratheon  in the  Battle of the Blackwater  and their new alliance with  House Tyrell . To prevent this, Vargo orders  Zollo  to chop Jaime's sword hand off, thinking that the blame will fall on Roose. [24] [7]  Vargo also hopes to give Jaime to Lord  Rickard Karstark , who seeks vengeance for Jaime having killed his sons Eddard and Torrhen in the  Whispering Wood . [25] 
 When the Brave Companions threaten to rape Brienne, Jaime advises her to "go away inside". For Jaime, the loss of his hand and with it his fighting ability destroys everything that he was. He falls into a deep depression and loses the will to live. Brienne reminds him that he has something to live for, namely, for his family and for revenge. [25] 
 While they are held at  Harrenhal  they share a bath in the bathhouse. Jaime divulges to Brienne the events surrounding the  Sack of King's Landing , including King  Aerys II Targaryen 's  wildfire plot . [7]  Brienne later remembers Jaime as "looking half a corpse and half a god". [80]  While at dinner, Roose hints that he will free Jaime as long as Jaime absolves him of the blame for the loss of his hand. Jaime agrees, and Lord Bolton orders  Steelshanks Walton  to escort him to King's Landing. Brienne is to remain behind as Lord Vargo's prize. [7] 
 When Roose leaves Harrenhal to join King Robb at the  Twins , Jaime asks him to give Robb his regards. Walton begins the journey to King's Landing with Jaime and a disgraced maester,  Qyburn . The latter's task is to keep Jaime healthy. When sleeping on a  weirwood  stump, Jaime has a dream about Brienne. Moved by this he goes back to Harrenhal and rescues Brienne from Vargo Hoat. [3]

 During their travels Jaime and Brienne learn that Robb and Catelyn were killed in the  Red Wedding , which was plotted by his father Tywin, Roose Bolton, and  Walder Frey . Unbeknownst to Jaime, Roose told Robb that Jaime sent his regards and then stabbed the king. Jaime also learns that his biological son, King  Joffrey I Baratheon , died at his own  wedding feast . [67] 
 By the time Jaime arrives in King's Landing, his hair has grown a bit, having become short and bristly. [67] [63]  His face is still thin and hollow, however, and he now has lines under his eyes, still making him look older. [54]  As the party arrives at the Red Keep they encounter Ser  Loras Tyrell , now a brother of the  Kingsguard . Loras accuses Brienne of murdering  Renly Baratheon . Again Jaime comes to her rescue and has Brienne arrested rather than allowing Loras to kill her. He then proceeds to the  Red Keep 's sept to see the mourning Cersei. Undaunted, the twins have sex in front of Joffrey's corpse. [67] 
 This turns out to be the last time that Jaime and Cersei share intimate relations, as their relationship begins to fall apart. Jaime has been changed by his imprisonment and prolonged exposure to Brienne's stubborn adherence to a code of honor. Tywin gives him a  Valyrian steel  blade, crafted out of  Eddard Stark 's greatsword  Ice , but Jaime feels insulted by his father's gift of a sword when he knows how useless he his without his sword hand. He quarrels with his father and refuses to resign from the Kingsguard. [67]  He calls a meeting of the order in  White Sword Tower  to take the measure of his Sworn Brothers and to remind them of their true duties. [54] 
 Jaime passes the Valyrian sword, now named  Oathkeeper , on to Brienne, tasking her to keep  Sansa Stark  safe from Cersei and noting the irony of her looking after Sansa with Eddard Stark's own steel. Ensuring that she is equally well provisioned by providing her with gold, a horse and armor, he also provides a letter sealed and signed by King  Tommen I Baratheon , declaring she is about the king's business and not to be hindered. The shield she is given is the one he bore from Harrenhal. [81] 
 Following Joffrey's death, Cersei accuses  Tyrion  of his murder. [66]  When both trial by words and  trial by battle  fail Tyrion, [41]  Jaime still does not believe that Tyrion is the murderer. He forces Lord  Varys  to arrange Tyrion's escape from imprisonment, during which Jaime confesses to his brother an old sin. Years ago Jaime had told him that  Tysha , the girl Tyrion had secretly married, was a  whore  hired by Jaime. Their father Tywin had the girl raped by his soldiers and by Tyrion himself to teach them a lesson. However, Tysha was the crofter's daughter as she claimed to be and had loved Tyrion genuinely. [63]  Incensed at this revelation, Tyrion hits Jaime, and, knowing that Joffrey was Jaime's son and not  Robert's , falsely claims responsibility for his murder. As a final revenge, Tyrion reveals the truth about Cersei's sexual escapades with Ser  Lancel Lannister  and Ser  Osmund Kettleblack . [63]  Tyrion storms off and, unknown to Jaime but with the aid of Varys and a secret passage, enters Tywin's private chambers and kills their father. [63] 
 
 A Feast for Crows 
 Jaime lets his hair grow out again, as well as his beard, [39]  though some hairs are starting to turn grey. [82]  Following the murder of their father, Tywin, by their brother, Tyrion, Cersei offers Jaime the position of  Hand of the King , but he refuses. [11] 
 Jaime remains in  King's Landing  and stands vigil over Tywin. During the night Cersei visits him again, begging him to accept the office of Hand but once again he refuses. Cersei leaves angrily, stating she was a fool for ever having loved him. In the morning service, the sight of Lord Tywin's rotting body distresses the young King Tommen, who flees, causing Jaime to pursue and comfort him, suggesting he "go away inside" to cope. Jaime suggests that Tommen and  Margaery Tyrell  be married. [2]  When this occurs, Lord  Mace Tyrell  is released from his promise of not leaving King's Landing until Margaery's marriage. [83]  During his next few days at King's Landing, Jaime finds himself increasingly at odds with his uncle, Ser  Kevan Lannister , and his sister, Cersei. He attempts to give his best counsel to both, as well as to a  Kingsguard , Ser  Loras Tyrell . [6] 
 Following the funeral of Tywin, Cersei commands Jaime to leave King's Landing with the intention of resolving the  siege of Riverrun . Jaime accepts, on the condition that he is allowed to bring the  King's Justice , Ser  Ilyn Payne . Riverrun is held by Ser  Brynden Tully , and is one of the last strongholds still loyal to the late King  Robb Stark . Before he departs the city Jaime has an armorer forge him a hand he can strap to his stump. The new hand, made of solid gold with mother of pearl fingernails, is sturdy and allows Jaime to clumsily strap a shield to his right hand. [82] 
 
   Jaime with his aunt,  Genna Lannister , by Pojypojy ©. 
 Jaime takes  Lewys Piper  and  Garrett Paege , who were made his squires as both of their families fought for  House Stark . Lewys names Jaime's new horses  Glory  and  Honor , and they are bedecked in Lannister crimson and Kingsguard white, respectively. [82]   Josmyn Peckledon  becomes another squire for Jaime as a reward for his bravery in the  Battle of the Blackwater , and Jaime later encourages Peck to treat  Pia  well. [46] 
 During the journey, Jaime spars with Ilyn during the nights, in order to train himself to fight left-handed. Along the way he stops at  Harrenhal , where he installs Ser  Bonifer Hasty  as castellan and releases the  northern  prisoners kept there, including Ser  Wylis Manderly . He has an angry confrontation with Red  Ronnet Connington  when he insults  Brienne of Tarth . [82]  To rid himself of Ronnet and  Gregor Clegane 's men-at-arms. Jaime charges them with escorting Wylis safely to  Maidenpool , where the northman will be put on a ship to his home of  White Harbor . [82] 
 After departing Harrenhal Jaime stops at  Darry  where his cousin, Lancel, confesses to having slept with Cersei. [43] 
 Jaime is met at Riverrun by his cousin, Ser  Daven Lannister , the new  Warden of the West . He holds a parley with Brynden, but is unsuccessful in convincing the Blackfish to surrender the castle. Ser  Ryman Frey , the commander of the  Frey  forces at Riverrun, has been halfheartedly threatening every day to hang Brynden's nephew, Lord  Edmure Tully , but Brynden has remained unfazed. [46]  Jaime also speaks with his aunt,  Genna Lannister , and her husband, Ser  Emmon Frey , who is to be rewarded with Riverrun after its capture. [46] 
 Jaime sends Ryman back to the  Twins  and places command of the Frey contingent with his son,  Edwyn Frey . Taking Edmure as his own prisoner, Jaime tells Edmure that he is to be released and returned to Riverrun. If he yields the castle, the  garrison  will be spared and all that wish to join the  Night's Watch  will be allowed to do so. If he does not surrender, the castle will be sacked and burned, and Jaime will return Edmure's child—by catapult—as soon as his wife  Roslin Frey  gives birth. [22]  Jaime has  Tom of Sevenstreams  sing " The Rains of Castamere " to intimidate Edmure; [22]  unbeknownst to Jaime, Tom is a member of the  brotherhood without banners  and has his own history with Edmure. [84] 
 Edmure decides to yield the castle and be taken to  Casterly Rock  as a prisoner, but not before allowing Brynden to escape by swimming under Riverrun's Water Gate at night. A furious Jaime and sends some of his men to find the Blackfish, but they are unsuccessful. [85]  Jaime sends Edmure west in a column led by Ser  Forley Prester ; also in Forley's company are the surviving  Westerlings . [85]  Maester  Vyman  brings Jaime a letter from Cersei, who has been imprisoned by the  new High Septon  and is to go on trial. Cersei requests Jaime as her champion in a potential trial by combat. Jaime does not reply to the letter and orders Peck to burn it. [85] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Jaime arrives at  Raventree Hall , the last holdout of  Robb Stark 's supporters. The castle is under  siege  by Lord  Jonos Bracken . Jaime finds the state of the siege to be dismal, and hopes to swiftly end it. His arrival is unexpected, and he strides into Bracken's tent while he is with  a whore . Jonos fills Jaime in on the situation at hand, and Jaime finds the scene rooted in the age-old feud between  Bracken  and  Blackwood . [86] 
 Jaimes then treats with Lord  Tytos Blackwood , who agrees to bend the knee to King  Tommen  and rescind his support of the  Stark  and  Tully  cause. In return, he must give up some of his lands to Jonos Bracken and send his son  Hoster  to the  Red Keep  as a hostage. Because of House Bracken's early support of Robb Stark, however, Jaime also requires Jonos to send one of his daughters to King's Landing as a hostage. [86] 
 After settling matters at Raventree, Jaime and his men head back to  Riverrun . They make camp at  Pennytree , where the locals are still wary of travelers and "king's men," and will not allow Jaime's men to enter the holdfast. Jaime decides not to follow the advice of Ser  Kennos of Kayce , who recommends that he storm the holdfast. While at Pennytree, Jaime receives an unexpected visit from  Brienne of Tarth . She tells Jaime that she has found  Sansa , who is a day's ride away. She claims, however, that Jaime must go with her alone or else the  Hound  will kill the girl. [86]

 Jaime:  Ser, you've been remiss in teaching our  new brothers  their duties. Meryn:  What duties? Jaime:  Keeping  the king  alive. How many monarchs have you lost since I left  the city ?  Two , is it? [67] —Jaime and  Meryn Trant 
 
 
 
 And me, that boy I was ... when did he die, I wonder? When I  donned the white cloak ? When I opened  Aerys's  throat? That boy had wanted to be Ser  Arthur Dayne , but someplace along the way he had become the  Smiling Knight  instead. [54] —thoughts of Jaime

[82] —Jaime and  Brynden Tully 
 
 Quotes about Jaime 
 They called him the  Lion  of  Lannister  to his face and whispered "Kingslayer" behind his back. Jon found it hard to look away from him. "This is what  a king  should look like", he thought to himself as he passed. [1] —thoughts of  Jon Snow 
 
 
 
 My brother is worth a hundred of  your friend . [36] — Cersei Lannister  to  Eddard Stark 
 
 
 
 Robert : Why should I mistrust him? He has done everything I have ever asked of him. His sword helped win  the throne  I sit on.

 He was weak from imprisonment, and chained at the wrists. No  knight  in the  Seven Kingdoms  could have stood against him at his full strength, with no chains to hamper him.

[29] —thoughts of  Brienne of Tarth 
 
 
 
 My brother, Jaime, thirsts for battle, not for power. He's run from every chance he's had to rule. [87] — Tyrion Lannister  to  Aegon Targaryen
