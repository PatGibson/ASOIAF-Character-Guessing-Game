 Appearance and Character 
 See also:  Images of Asha Greyjoy 
 As a child Asha was a skinny girl with knob knees and a face full of pimples. [1] [4]  Now in her mid-twenties, Asha is lean and long legged, with dark eyes and black hair cut short. Her face is thin, with a big, sharp nose, and wind-chafed skin. On her neck is a faded pink scar. [1]  Asha's brother,  Theon Greyjoy , believes her hawk-like nose [5]  is too big and sharp for her small face, but he feels that her wicked smile makes up for it. [1] 
 Asha is a wild and headstrong young woman, [6] [2]  raised by her mother to be bold. [4]  There is a boldness to the way she walks; part saunter, part sway. [1]  She possesses a sharp wit, [1]  and has no problem with holding her own against men, both in a verbal battle [1] [7]  and in a physical fight. [2]  Asha enjoys  ale [1]  and  wine . [7] [2]  Defying the classical  gender roles  of  Westerosi  culture, Asha was appalled early on by the idea of becoming a lord's wife. [4]  After her older two brothers died and her younger brother was taken hostage, Asha's father  Balon  began to see her as his heir, treating her like he would a son. [6] [7] [8] 
 Asha's attire includes a brown quilted tunic, [7]  breeches of black [2]  or green wool, [7]  a studded belt, [4]  and salt-stained high leather boots. [7]  She sometimes wears a sleeveless leather jerkin half-unlaced, [7]  and she also owns a green leather jerkin covered with overlapping plates of steel. [2]  Asha prefers throwing axes, [2]  which she has been practicing with since she was just a little girl, [7]  but she also keeps a dirk with her. [1] 
 Asha personally leads her men into battle. [2]  She captains her own ship,  Black Wind , [9]  and has the devotion of her crew, [4]  who take a perverse pride in the deeds of their female captain. According to Asha, half of them love her like a daughter, while the other half want to sleep with her. [4]  Regardless, Asha loves her men, [2]  and is willing to die for them, as they are for her. [4]  Asha is also well liked by the servants of  Pyke  and people of  Lordsport . [1]  Asha is not devoted to the  Drowned God . [10] 
 While her counterpart in the television series  Game of Thrones , Yara Greyjoy, is bisexual,  George R. R. Martin  has confirmed that Asha is not. [11] 
 
 History 
 Asha was fairly unattractive in her youth. Her uncle,  Victarion Greyjoy , remembers Asha as a little girl swimming naked in the sea and playing with her doll. [7]  Asha's eldest siblings,  Rodrik  and  Maron , died during  Greyjoy's Rebellion , and her younger brother  Theon  departed for  Winterfell  to be  Eddard Stark 's hostage and ward. Asha thus became Lord  Balon Greyjoy 's only remaining child in  Pyke . [4] 
 Asha's mother, Lady  Alannys Harlaw , fostered five boys at Pyke after Theon's departure. Asha experimented with  Tristifer Botley , the boy closest to Asha in age, during puberty, although his feels were stronger than hers. [4]  Tris was sent away to  Blacktyde  after Maester  Qalen  caught the youths together. [4] 
 Asha grew into an attractive and bold young woman, [1]  and Balon effectively raised his wild and headstrong daughter as his heir. [6]  However, Asha preferred  Ten Towers , the seat of her uncle  Rodrik Harlaw , to Pyke. She lost her virtue at age 16 to a sailor from  Lys . [4]  In  293 AC  or  294 AC  Asha sailed  Black Wind  on a trading voyage which included stops at  Fair Isle ,  Lannisport , and the  Arbor , where she introduced peaches to one of her lovers,  Qarl the Maid . [2]  Asha was away raiding Lyseni  pirates  at the  Stepstones  when her father exiled her uncle,  Euron Crow's Eye , from the  Iron Islands  in  297 AC  for having impregnated Victarion's  third wife . [9] [7] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Clash of Kings 
   The Kraken's Daughter – by Finer © 
 Upon  Theon Greyjoy 's return to the  Iron Islands , Asha is reported to be on  Great Wyk  taking messages for her father  Balon ,  Lord of the Iron Islands . [9]  After sailing back to  Pyke  with Lord  Gorold Goodbrother , Asha passes herself off as Esgred, a shipwright's wife in  Lordsport , and flirts with Theon to learn his nature. Theon's naive arrogance amuses her, but Theon grows angry at Asha's deception and her position. At a feast that night at Pyke, Asha takes the place of honor beside their father, making Theon feel cheated. [1] 
 During the  War of the Five Kings , Asha commands thirty longships for Balon's invasion of the  north . [1]  After stopping at  Ten Towers  to visit her mother,  Alannys Harlaw , [4]  Asha leads the  taking of Deepwood Motte . [1]  After the  capture of Winterfell , Theon sends  Stygg  to request reinforcements from his sister. [12]  Asha travels through the  wolfswood  to visit Theon at  Winterfell , but she refuses to stay and help him defend the castle since it is so far inland. [5]  The ten men left by Asha eventually abandon Theon prior to the  battle at Winterfell . [13] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
 Balon,  King of the Isles and the North , is reported to have fallen to his death at Pyke. [14] 
 
 A Feast for Crows 
   Asha at the kingsmoot © Marc Simonetti 
 Asha's uncle,  Aeron Greyjoy , is outraged at the prospect of a woman ruling the  ironborn  or of his brother,  Euron Greyjoy , claiming the throne, so the priest calls for a  kingsmoot  on  Old Wyk . [6] 
 Asha returns to the isles after her father's death to claim the  Seastone Chair , bringing with her the captive Lady  Sybelle Glover  and her children,  Gawen  and infant  Erena Glover . At  Ten Towers , Asha informs her uncle, Lord  Rodrik Harlaw , that she searched for Theon at Winterfell after it was  sacked  but was unable to identify him amongst the bodies. [4] [7]  Most of her support comes from  House Harlaw , the house of her mother, Lady  Alannys Harlaw , but Asha is also supported by  Tristifer Botley  (whose marriage proposal she refuses), Lord  Baelor Blacktyde , Lord  Meldred Merlyn , and  Harmund Sharp . [15]  Rodrik offers to name Asha his heir to Ten Towers, though not to become head of his house. She refuses, desiring instead the throne of her father. [4] 
 On Old Wyk, Asha realizes that she does not have as much support as she had hoped. She instead offers to share rule and back her uncle  Victarion , the  Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet , if he will make her his  Hand of the King . Victarion refuses, as no King of the Isles had ever had one, much less a woman, and he disagrees with her plans to end the war. [7]  At the kingsmoot, Asha challenges the ancient and obese  Erik Ironmaker  to rise from his chair, his support crumbling when he cannot. When she makes her own claim, her champions are Tris Botley, Ser  Harras Harlaw , and  Qarl the Maid . With the proposal to make peace and alliance with the  north  in exchange for  Sea Dragon Point  and the  Stony Shore , Asha achieves a surprising amount of support. The crowd, however, ultimately favors her uncle, Euron Crow's Eye, [8]  and Asha flees with her crew. [16] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 While at  Ten Towers  following the  kingsmoot , Asha learns her uncle, King  Euron , married her to  Erik Ironmaker  after she fled  Old Wyk , using a seal to represent her at the wedding. Asha curses this but admires Euron's cunning: this move prevents Asha from offering a marriage to another lord and winning his support. She returns to  Deepwood Motte  with four longships, less than two hundred men, and Lady Glover, whose children remain at Ten Towers. [2]  After the  fall of Moat Cailin ,  Ramsay Bolton  sends a strip of  Theon Greyjoy 's flayed skin from  Barrowton  to Deepwood, warning Asha to leave the  north  or share her brother's fate. [2] 
 Asha sleeps with  Qarl the Maid  and refuses  Tristifer Botley 's recommendation to flee and become a merchant, although Tris does remind her of the story of  Torgon the Latecomer . When Deepwood comes under attack by King  Stannis Baratheon 's army, Asha kills a  Flint  scout and then flees with her ironmen toward their ships on the  Bay of Ice . [2]  They are overwhelmed in the  wolfswood , however, and defeated in the  fight by Deepwood Motte . [2]   Alysane Mormont  burns or captures Asha's longships. [17] 
 Asha is taken captive and continues with Stannis's host during their  march on Winterfell . Alysane guards the king's prize, who is fettered in a covered wayn and thinks her ankle is broken. [10]  Ser  Justin Massey  courts Asha, who thinks the  knight  wants to wed her to claim the  Iron Islands , and  Morgan Liddle  apologizes to Asha for having insulted her during the battle. [10] 
 A snow storm sets in during their march, however, and the army slows to a halt at a  crofters' village  approximately three days ride from Winterfell, with few provisions left. [10]   Queen's men  such as Ser  Clayton Suggs  call for Asha to be sacrificed to  R'hllor  in an attempt to thwart the snows, and she witnesses the burning of  Peasebury  men accused of cannibalism. [18]  Asha and Clayton are met by  Tycho Nestoris  of the  Iron Bank of Braavos , who has arrived from Deepwood with an escort made of Asha's surviving crew, including Qarl and Tris. [18]  Also with them are " Arya Stark " and Theon, who have escaped from Ramsay at Winterfell, [19]  but Asha barely recognizes her tortured brother. [18] 
 
 The Winds of Winter 
 
 
 
   Warning    This information has thus far been released in a sample chapter for  The Winds of Winter , and might therefore not be in finalized form. Keep in mind that the content as described below is still subject to change. 
 Asha is distressed when she sees what  Ramsay Bolton  did to her brother. Brought before Stannis and a chained Theon, she offers a ransom for her brother. Stannis refuses, as his northern allies would then abandon him. While the  queen's men  want Stannis to burn Theon for what he allegedly did to  Bran  and  Rickon Stark  after the  capture of Winterfell , Asha urges the king to behead Theon personally, before a  heart tree , as Lord  Eddard Stark  would have done.
