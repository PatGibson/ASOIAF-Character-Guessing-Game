[1] [4] Now in her mid-twenties, Asha is lean and long legged, with dark eyes and black hair cut short. Her face is thin, with a big, sharp nose, and wind-chafed skin. On her neck is a faded pink scar. [1] Asha's brother, Theon Greyjoy , believes her hawk-like nose [5] is too big and sharp for her small face, but he feels that her wicked smile makes up for it. [1]  Asha is a wild and headstrong young woman, [6] [2] raised by her mother to be bold. [4] There is a boldness to the way she walks; part saunter, part sway. [1] She possesses a sharp wit, [1] and has no problem with holding her own against men, both in a verbal battle [1] [7] and in a physical fight. [2] Asha enjoys ale [1] and wine . [7] [2] Defying the classical gender roles of Westerosi culture, Asha was appalled early on by the idea of becoming a lord's wife. [4] After her older two brothers died and her younger brother was taken hostage, Asha's father Balon began to see her as his heir, treating her like he would a son. [6] [7] [8]  Asha's attire includes a brown quilted tunic, [7] breeches of black [2] or green wool, [7] a studded belt, [4] and salt-stained high leather boots. [7] She sometimes wears a sleeveless leather jerkin half-unlaced, [7] and she also owns a green leather jerkin covered with overlapping plates of steel. [2] Asha prefers throwing axes, [2] which she has been practicing with since she was just a little girl, [7] but she also keeps a dirk with her. [1]  Asha personally leads her men into battle. [2] She captains her own ship, Black Wind , [9] and has the devotion of her crew, [4] who take a perverse pride in the deeds of their female captain. According to Asha, half of them love her like a daughter, while the other half want to sleep with her. [4] Regardless, Asha loves her men, [2] and is willing to die for them, as they are for her. [4] Asha is also well liked by the servants of Pyke and people of Lordsport . [1] Asha is not devoted to the Drowned God . [10]  While her counterpart in the television series Game of Thrones , Yara Greyjoy, is bisexual, George R. R. Martin has confirmed that Asha is not. [11]   History  Asha was fairly unattractive in her youth. Her uncle, Victarion Greyjoy , remembers Asha as a little girl swimming naked in the sea and playing with her doll. [7] Asha's eldest siblings, Rodrik and Maron , died during Greyjoy's Rebellion , and her younger brother Theon departed for Winterfell to be Eddard Stark 's hostage and ward. Asha thus became Lord Balon Greyjoy 's only remaining child in Pyke . [4]  Asha's mother, Lady Alannys Harlaw , fostered five boys at Pyke after Theon's departure. Asha experimented with Tristifer Botley , the boy closest to Asha in age, during puberty, although his feels were stronger than hers. [4] Tris was sent away to Blacktyde after Maester Qalen caught the youths together. [4]  Asha grew into an attractive and bold young woman, [1] and Balon effectively raised his wild and headstrong daughter as his heir. [6] However, Asha preferred Ten Towers , the seat of her uncle Rodrik Harlaw , to Pyke. She lost her virtue at age 16 to a sailor from Lys . [4] In 293 AC or 294 AC Asha sailed Black Wind on a trading voyage which included stops at Fair Isle , Lannisport , and the Arbor , where she introduced peaches to one of her lovers, Qarl the Maid . [2] Asha was away raiding Lyseni pirates at the Stepstones when her father exiled her uncle, Euron Crow's Eye , from the Iron Islands in 297 AC for having impregnated Victarion's third wife . [9] [7]   Recent Events  A Clash of Kings   The Kraken's Daughter – by Finer ©  Upon Theon Greyjoy 's return to the Iron Islands , Asha is reported to be on Great Wyk taking messages for her father Balon , Lord of the Iron Islands . [9] After sailing back to Pyke with Lord Gorold Goodbrother , Asha passes herself off as Esgred, a shipwright's wife in Lordsport , and flirts with Theon to learn his nature. Theon's naive arrogance amuses her, but Theon grows angry at Asha's deception and her position. At a feast that night at Pyke, Asha takes the place of honor beside their father, making Theon feel cheated. [1]  During the War of the Five Kings , Asha commands thirty longships for Balon's invasion of the north . [1] After stopping at Ten Towers to visit her mother, Alannys Harlaw , [4] Asha leads the taking of Deepwood Motte . [1] After the capture of Winterfell , Theon sends Stygg to request reinforcements from his sister. [12] Asha travels through the wolfswood to visit Theon at Winterfell , but she refuses to stay and help him defend the castle since it is so far inland. [5] The ten men left by Asha eventually abandon Theon prior to the battle at Winterfell . [13]   A Storm of Swords  Balon, King of the Isles and the North , is reported to have fallen to his death at Pyke. [14]   A Feast for Crows   Asha at the kingsmoot © Marc Simonetti  Asha's uncle, Aeron Greyjoy , is outraged at the prospect of a woman ruling the ironborn or of his brother, Euron Greyjoy , claiming the throne, so the priest calls for a kingsmoot on Old Wyk . [6]  Asha returns to the isles after her father's death to claim the Seastone Chair , bringing with her the captive Lady Sybelle Glover and her children, Gawen and infant Erena Glover . At Ten Towers , Asha informs her uncle, Lord Rodrik Harlaw , that she searched for Theon at Winterfell after it was sacked but was unable to identify him amongst the bodies. [4] [7] Most of her support comes from House Harlaw , the house of her mother, Lady Alannys Harlaw , but Asha is also supported by Tristifer Botley (whose marriage proposal she refuses), Lord Baelor Blacktyde , Lord Meldred Merlyn , and Harmund Sharp . [15] Rodrik offers to name Asha his heir to Ten Towers, though not to become head of his house. She refuses, desiring instead the throne of her father. [4]  On Old Wyk, Asha realizes that she does not have as much support as she had hoped. She instead offers to share rule and back her uncle Victarion , the Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet , if he will make her his Hand of the King . Victarion refuses, as no King of the Isles had ever had one, much less a woman, and he disagrees with her plans to end the war. [7] At the kingsmoot, Asha challenges the ancient and obese Erik Ironmaker to rise from his chair, his support crumbling when he cannot. When she makes her own claim, her champions are Tris Botley, Ser Harras Harlaw , and Qarl the Maid . With the proposal to make peace and alliance with the north in exchange for Sea Dragon Point and the Stony Shore , Asha achieves a surprising amount of support. The crowd, however, ultimately favors her uncle, Euron Crow's Eye, [8] and Asha flees with her crew. [16]   A Dance with Dragons  While at Ten Towers following the kingsmoot , Asha learns her uncle, King Euron , married her to Erik Ironmaker after she fled Old Wyk , using a seal to represent her at the wedding. Asha curses this but admires Euron's cunning: this move prevents Asha from offering a marriage to another lord and winning his support. She returns to Deepwood Motte with four longships, less than two hundred men, and Lady Glover, whose children remain at Ten Towers. [2] After the fall of Moat Cailin , Ramsay Bolton sends a strip of Theon Greyjoy 's flayed skin from Barrowton to Deepwood, warning Asha to leave the north or share her brother's fate. [2]  Asha sleeps with Qarl the Maid and refuses Tristifer Botley 's recommendation to flee and become a merchant, although Tris does remind her of the story of Torgon the Latecomer . When Deepwood comes under attack by King Stannis Baratheon 's army, Asha kills a Flint scout and then flees with her ironmen toward their ships on the Bay of Ice . [2] They are overwhelmed in the wolfswood , however, and defeated in the fight by Deepwood Motte . [2]  Alysane Mormont burns or captures Asha's longships. [17]  Asha is taken captive and continues with Stannis's host during their march on Winterfell . Alysane guards the king's prize, who is fettered in a covered wayn and thinks her ankle is broken. [10] Ser Justin Massey courts Asha, who thinks the knight wants to wed her to claim the Iron Islands , and Morgan Liddle apologizes to Asha for having insulted her during the battle. [10]  A snow storm sets in during their march, however, and the army slows to a halt at a crofters' village approximately three days ride from Winterfell, with few provisions left. [10]  Queen's men such as Ser Clayton Suggs call for Asha to be sacrificed to R'hllor in an attempt to thwart the snows, and she witnesses the burning of Peasebury men accused of cannibalism. [18] Asha and Clayton are met by Tycho Nestoris of the Iron Bank of Braavos , who has arrived from Deepwood with an escort made of Asha's surviving crew, including Qarl and Tris. [18] Also with them are " Arya Stark " and Theon, who have escaped from Ramsay at Winterfell, [19] but Asha barely recognizes her tortured brother. [18]   The Winds of Winter      Warning  This information has thus far been released in a sample chapter for The Winds of Winter , and might therefore not be in finalized form. Keep in mind that the content as described below is still subject to change.  Asha is distressed when she sees what Ramsay Bolton did to her brother. Brought before Stannis and a chained Theon, she offers a ransom for her brother. Stannis refuses, as his northern allies would then abandon him. While the queen's men want Stannis to burn Theon for what he allegedly did to Bran and Rickon Stark after the capture of Winterfell , Asha urges the king to behead Theon personally, before a heart tree , as Lord Eddard Stark would have done.
