 A Game of Thrones 
   Rickon and  Shaggydog  in the  crypts of Winterfell , by Chris Casciano © Fantasy Flight Games 
 Lord  Eddard Stark  allows his children to adopt a litter of  direwolves  found by  Jon Snow . [18]  Rickon is initially afraid of his pup, [19]  which he eventually names  Shaggydog . [20]  When King  Robert I Baratheon  visits  Winterfell , Jon prods his half brother on when Rickon stops during the procession. [21] 
 When he departs for  King's Landing  to serve Robert as  Hand of the King , Eddard leaves his youngest son at Winterfell with the boy's mother,  Catelyn Stark , and eldest brother,  Robb . [17]   Bran Stark  was supposed to join his sisters,  Sansa  and  Arya , with Eddard in the capital, but Rickon's older brother becomes comatose after falling from the  First Keep . [20] 
 A grief-stricken Catelyn lingers at Bran's bedside, so Rickon follows Robb around, crying. After Bran wakes from his coma, Catelyn departs Winterfell to inform Eddard of the  catspaw  assassin, leaving Robb to rule the castle. [6]  Rickon enjoys running with Shaggydog,  Grey Wind , and  Summer —the direwolves of Robb and Bran—in the castle's yard. [8]  Rickon becomes upset whenever Robb departs Winterfell to address matters in the  north . [8]  Rickon calls Shaggy back to him when the direwolves threaten  Tyrion Lannister . [8] 
 Having learned that Robb is marching south to rescue their father from imprisonment in King's Landing, an upset Rickon hides in the  crypt of Winterfell . Rickon slashes at Robb's men with a rusty sword and Shaggydog wounds  Gage  and  Mikken . Rickon cries even more when Shaggy is chained in  Farlen 's kennel, and the boy refuses to bid farewell when Robb departs Winterfell. [22] 
 Bran has a dream of Eddard in the crypt, so  Osha  and Maester  Luwin  bring the boy to the vaults so he can see that his father's tomb is empty. Shaggydog jumps out of the shadows and wounds Luwin, however, and Summer begins fighting with Shaggy. Four-year-old Rickon, who had freed Shaggy from the kennel, explains that he had also dreamed that Eddard would be coming home. Rickon accompanies the group to Luwin's tower, and the maester shows  obsidian  arrowheads to the boys. Rickon cries when a  raven  then arrives at the tower bringing word that Eddard has been executed by order of King  Joffrey I Baratheon  in the capital. [23] 
 After the  Battle of the Camps , Robb is proclaimed  King in the North  at  Riverrun  by  northmen  and  rivermen . [24]

[25]  When Little Walder knocks the boy into a pool while playing  lord of the crossing , Shaggy leaps at the guest. Rickon then becomes friends with the Frey cousins, playing other games like  monsters and maidens ,  rats and cats , and  come-into-my-castle . Bran is angered when his brother shows the  crypt of Winterfell  to their guests. [25]  Rickon sits near the Freys during the  harvest feast . [15] 
 With his mother Catelyn away in the south, Rickon refuses to have his hair cut and instead bites a girl who tries to cut his long, unruly hair. [15]  Ser  Rodrik Cassel , the castellan of Winterfell, confines the direwolves in the godswood after Shaggy bit Little Walder. [25]  Maester Luwin discounts the dreams which Bran and Rickon experienced before Winterfell was informed of Lord Eddard's death, [26]  while  Jojen Reed  explains he has had  green dreams  of the Stark brothers in the crypt [9]  and also of the boys being flayed by  Reek . [9] 
 Rickon became a hostage of  Theon Greyjoy  after the  capture of Winterfell  by  ironborn .  Meera Reed  protects Rickon when  Stygg  kills Mikken. [27]  After Osha,  Hodor , the direwolves, and the Reed and Stark siblings vanish from the castle, Theon and Reek hunt for them in the  wolfswood  to no avail. [16]  The hunters instead kill two miller's boys at the  Acorn Water , with Reek flaying the children and Theon presenting their tarred heads to Winterfell as those of the missing Starks. [28] 
 During the  Battle of the Blackwater ,  Sansa Stark  sings for her siblings. [29]   Arya Stark  becomes teary eyed at  Harrenhal  after learning of her brothers' fate. [30] 
 Rickon and his companions have secretly hid from Theon in the crypts, however, and they survive the  sack of Winterfell  by Reek, who is actually  Ramsay Snow . [31] [1]  The group emerges to find Winterfell in ruins and a mortally wounded Maester  Luwin , who tells them that Bran and Rickon need to be separated and taken into hiding. Osha agrees to look after Rickon, taking the prince and Shaggydog to parts unknown. [1] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
 Traveling north toward the  Wall ,  Bran Stark  wonders if  Osha  took his brother to  White Harbor  or the  Last Hearth . [32] 
 Robb Stark , the  King in the North , sleeps with  Jeyne Westerling  at the  Crag  after having been informed of his brothers' supposed deaths. Robb then marries Jeyne, breaking his promise to marry a daughter of Lord  Walder Frey . [33]  Believing that Bran and Rickon are dead,  Catelyn Stark  frees Ser  Jaime Lannister  from captivity at  Riverrun  and tasks him with retrieving  Sansa  and  Arya  from  King's Landing . [34] [35]  After Lord  Hoster Tully  dies at Riverrun, Catelyn thinks her father will be awaited in the afterlife by his grandsons, Bran and Rickon. [36]  Maester  Aemon  informs  Jon Snow  of his brothers' murders when the youth returns to  Castle Black  after the  great ranging . [37] 
 Sansa, expecting to marry  Willas Tyrell , hopes to one day name sons after Rickon, Bran, and Eddard. [38]  Lord  Tywin Lannister  forces her to marry  Tyrion Lannister , [39] [40]  however, so that  House Lannister  can one day claim Winterfell. [36]  To prevent that possibility, King Robb names his half brother Jon as his heir. [41] [42]  Robb and Catelyn are then murdered by  Freys  and  Boltons  in the  Red Wedding , however. [43] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Most of  Westeros  believes Rickon dead, but Lord  Wyman Manderly  and  Robett Glover  learn from  Wex Pyke , Theon's onetime squire and a survivor of the sack of Winterfell, that the boy is alive. Wex tells them—via writing and chalk drawings since he cannot speak—that Ramsay killed Rodrik Cassel, not Theon, in the  battle at Winterfell , and that Wex followed a boy, a woman, and a direwolf after they left the castle. [44]  Wex learned that Osha was taking Rickon to  Skagos . [45] 
 When Lord  Davos Seaworth  attempts to convince Lord Manderly to take up  Stannis Baratheon 's cause, Wyman brings Wex into their meeting in the  New Castle  and explains to Davos what Wex witnessed. Wyman explains that in order for  House Manderly  to take Stannis as king, Davos must use his smuggling skills to retrieve Rickon, the heir of  House Stark  with Robb dead and Bran's fate unknown, from Skagos. [44] 
 Ramsay, who is now  Lord of Winterfell , [46]  intends to kill Bran and Rickon with  his hounds  if the Stark boys reappear. [47] 
 
 The Winds of Winter 
 
 
 
   Warning    This information has thus far been released in a sample chapter for  The Winds of Winter , and might therefore not be in finalized form. Keep in mind that the content as described below is still subject to change. 
 Northmen  in Stannis's army at the  crofters' village  want the king to execute Theon for having killed supposedly Bran and Rickon. Theon, who has been tortured by Ramsay, incoherently tries to explain his actions to his sister,  Asha Greyjoy . [48] 
 
 Quotes by Rickon 
   Art Parkinson as Rickon in  Game of Thrones 
 Rickon : You let  my father  be. You let him be. Bran : Rickon. Father's not  here . Rickon : Yes he is. I saw him. I saw him last night. [23] —Rickon to  Luwin  and  Bran Stark 
 
 
 
 Are we going  home ? I want my horse. And I want applecakes and butter and honey, and  Shaggy . Are we going where Shaggydog is? [1] —Rickon to  Bran Stark 
 
 Quotes about Rickon 
 Rickon needs you. He's only three, he doesn't understand what's happening. He thinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows me around all day, clutching my leg and crying. I don't know what to do with him. [6] — Robb Stark  to  Catelyn Stark 
 
 
 
 His baby brother had been wild as a winter storm since he learned  Robb  was riding off to  war , weeping and angry by turns. [22] —thoughts of  Bran Stark 
 
 
 
 Though he knew Lord  Eddard  was dead, sometimes Rickon forgot ... willfully, Bran suspected. His little brother was stubborn as only a boy of four can be. [9] —thoughts of  Bran Stark 
 
 
 
 Brienne : I ... there are no words, my lady. My good lady. Your sons, they ... they're with  the gods  now. Catelyn : Are they? What god would let this happen? Rickon was only a baby. How could he deserve such a death? [11] — Brienne of Tarth  and  Catelyn Stark 
 
 
 
 Roose Bolton  has Lord Eddard's  daughter . To thwart him  White Harbor  must have  Ned's  son ... and  the direwolf . The wolf will prove the boy is who we say he is, should the  Dreadfort  attempt to deny him. That is my price, Lord Davos. Smuggle me back my liege lord, and I will take  Stannis Baratheon  as my king. [44] — Wyman Manderly  to  Davos Seaworth
