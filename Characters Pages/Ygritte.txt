Her most distinctive feature was her fiery red hair. The wildlings consider red hair to be lucky and describe those with it as having been " kissed by fire ." [2]  Despite her unconventional features, Jon Snow sees her as beautiful.  Recent Events   Ygritte by Anja Dalisa ©  A Clash of Kings  Ygritte is part of a wildling scouting party in Rattleshirt 's band, including Orell and one other, that is ambushed in the Skirling Pass by men of the Night's Watch including Jon Snow and Stonesnake . Her companions are slain, but Ygritte is spared as Jon balks at killing a woman. She yields, but only offers very minimal information. As she and Jon wait for the arrival of Qhorin Halfhand , Jon reveals to her that he is Ned Stark's bastard, and she tells him the story of Bael the Bard , a song which insinuates that the Starks have wildling blood as well. Jon scoffs at this idea, calling the Bard a liar. She shrugs it off and is brought to the Halfhand, who instructs Jon to do what must be done with her. Presuming that to be an order to kill her, Jon nevertheless lets her escape. [3]  She is present when Jon Snow, under Qhorin's implicit command, slays the Halfhand and purports to turn his cloak. [4]   A Storm of Swords  After Jon meets with Mance Rayder and convinces him he has turned his cloak in truth, he is told to ride with Tormund Giantsbane . Ygritte follows him to Tormund's company and routinely beds down next to him, though he initially refuses her advances. When the wildling band, now well on its way to the Wall, comes upon the scene of the slaughter at the Fist of the First Men , Mance is furious with Jon as he did not warn him of the Night's Watch force there. To save Jon, Ygritte lies and tells Mance that the two are sexually involved. This knowledge helps to convince Mance that Jon has turned his cloak in truth. That night, Ygritte seduces him, and the two begin a torrid, intensely sexual affair as they march for the Wall. When Jon is commanded to join with Styr as part of the advance party for the assault on the Wall, which is to scale the Wall and attack Castle Black from the south, Ygritte joins him. South of the Wall, at Queenscrown , Styr's band comes upon a lone knight, whom they capture. Styr, still suspicious of Jon's true loyalties, orders Jon to slay the man. Jon refuses, and Ygritte slits the man's throat instead. In the confusion created by a raging thunderstorm and the sudden emergence of Summer , Bran Stark 's direwolf , Jon escapes, despite Ygritte shooting him in the leg with an arrow as he starts to run. Ygritte continues to Castle Black with Styr's band, but Jon has forewarned the castle of their arrival and the attack is thwarted. Along with the rest of the wildling band, Ygritte is killed, mortally wounded by an arrow - though not Jon's. Jon finds her on the battlefield, where she dies in his arms.
