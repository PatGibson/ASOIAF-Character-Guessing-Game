He is only capable of saying one word, Hodor. [3] The Stark children believed this to be his name, until enlightened by Old Nan , his great-grandmother, that his real name is Walder. [2]  Hodor is over seven feet tall, with brown eyes, [4] a brown beard, [5] and thick brown hair all over his body. [3] It is been suggested by Osha that his large size (and perhaps his body hair) is a result of giants ' blood. [3]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones  After Bran Stark 's fall, he needs a way to move about the castle. Maester Luwin designs a basket that can be strapped to Hodor's back and in which Bran can be placed. Hodor has served as Bran's way of transportation since. However, Hodor, being a simpleton, sometimes forgets that Bran is in the basket, which causes Bran moments of pain. [3]   A Clash of Kings  After Theon Greyjoy  takes Winterfell , Hodor hides in the crypts along with Osha , Bran , Rickon , Meera Reed and Jojen Reed , faking their escape out of the castle. They eventually leave the crypts only to find the castle destroyed . After speaking to the dying Maester Luwin , it is decided that Bran and Rickon should be split up. Hodor goes with Bran, Jojen and Meera north to the Wall . [6]   A Storm of Swords  Hodor flees with Bran, Meera, and Jojen north toward the Wall. They eventually reach the Nightfort and meet Samwell Tarly of the Night's Watch . He leads them through a secret door at the bottom of a well that takes them through to the north side of the Wall. There they meet Coldhands , an enigmatic figure of uncertain allegiance. [7]   A Dance with Dragons  They reach the cave of the three-eyed crow , but are ambushed by wights just outside the cave's entrance. Bran uses his ability as a skinchanger to enter Hodor to fight off the wights, but blacks out and wakes up inside the cave. The cave is warded against white walkers and wights, so Coldhands cannot accompany them inside. Inside the cave, the group meet the remaining children of the forest and the three-eyed crow . [8] While inside the cave, Bran continues to enter Hodor to explore the deeper parts of the cave. Hodor has become used to Bran's presence in his mind, though he still feels fear when it happens and retreats to a place where Bran cannot reach him. [9]   Quotes  Hodor!
