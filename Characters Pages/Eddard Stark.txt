 Appearance and Character

 Eddard has a long face [9]  and long brown hair. [10]  He is thirty-five, but his closely-trimmed beard is beginning to grey, making him look older than his years. [10]  His dark grey eyes [10]  reflect his moods, turning soft as fog or hard as stone. [11]  Eddard is shorter and less handsome than his older brother  Brandon  had been, according to  Catelyn Stark ; however, she also states that Ned has a "good sweet heart beneath his solemn face". [12]  He keeps faith with the  old gods . [1]  He is fiercely protective of his wife and children, whom he loves deeply.
 Eddard is known for his unwavering sense of honor [13] [14]  and justice and his family finds him kind, although some consider his reserved personality a sign of coldness and disdain. [15]  Among his enemies, Eddard has the reputation of having cold, judgmental eyes [16]  thought to reflect his frozen heart. [17] 
 While riding his great warhorse in the north, Ned wears furs and leathers. [10]  Ned also wears silk [18]  and linen [19]  tunics and a belt of heavy silver links. [19]  His surcoat is fine white velvet with a  direwolf  badge over the heart. [11]  Ned's cloaks are grey with white, [20]  as well as black wool. [21] 
 Lord Stark wields sword [22]  and dagger, [23]  although he uses  Ice , a  Valyrian steel  greatsword, for ceremonial purposes. [10]   Jory Cassel  is captain of  Ned's guards . [10] 
 
 History 
 Youth 
 Eddard was born at  Winterfell [5]  as the second son of Lord  Rickard Stark  and Lady  Lyarra Stark . He had one older brother,  Brandon , and two younger siblings,  Lyanna  and  Benjen . [24] [25] 
 Eddard was  fostered  by Lord  Jon Arryn  at the  Eyrie  from the age of eight. [1] [9]  There, Eddard befriended his fellow ward,  Robert Baratheon , while Lord Jon became like a second father to him. [1]  When he reached the age of sixteen, Eddard was a man grown, and divided his time between Winterfell and the Eyrie. [26]  During one of his visits to Winterfell, Eddard carried a wedding proposal from Robert to his father, Lord Rickard, who agreed to betroth his daughter Lyanna to Eddard's friend. [5] [22]  When Lyanna later expressed that her belief that Robert would never keep to one bed, having heard about  Mya Stone , Robert's bastard daughter in the  Vale of Arryn , Eddard recalled having seen the child, and was unable to deny her existence. [22]  Lord  Rodrik Ryswell  hoped to wed his daughter  Barbrey  to Brandon or Eddard. [27] 
 
 Tourney at Harrenhal 
   Rhaegar Targaryen , Eddard, and  Lyanna , by M. Luisa Giliberti © 
 In  281 AC , at the age of eighteen, Eddard came down from the Eyrie to attend the  tourney at Harrenhal . [14]  Also present were Eddard's foster brother Robert, his foster father Jon, and his three siblings, Brandon, Lyanna, and  Benjen . [3]  It was during this tourney that Eddard met  Howland Reed , one of his father's bannermen. Howland and Eddard remained friends for the rest of their lives. During the opening feast, Eddard saw  Ashara Dayne , a lady-in-waiting to Princess  Elia Martell . He danced with her later that night, but only after his older brother Brandon had spoken to her on his behalf, since he himself was too shy. [3]  Eddard was present during the final jousts, where Prince  Rhaegar Targaryen  passed over his own wife, Elia, to crown Lyanna the  queen of love and beauty . Eddard would remember this moment as "the moment when all smiles died" years later. [14] 
 The following year, Eddard's sister Lyanna was abducted by Prince Rhaegar. [28]  Brandon rode to  King's Landing  in anger, but he was arrested when he threatened the crown prince. Lord Rickard Stark was summoned to King's Landing, and when he demanded a  trial by combat , both he and Brandon were executed at the command of King  Aerys II Targaryen . [29]  Aerys's next step was to demand that Jon Arryn send him the heads of his former wards, Eddard and Robert. Jon refused and instead called his banners. [1] 
 
 Robert's Rebellion 
   Robert Baratheon  and Eddard, by Tomasz Jedruszek © Fantasy Flight Games 
 With his father and brother dead, Eddard was now the  Lord of Winterfell . He wanted to raise his banners to join  Robert's Rebellion , but getting from the  Vale of Arryn  to the  north  was complicated by the loyalty to the  Iron Throne  of  Gulltown , the Vale's chief port. [30] [31]  Eddard crossed the  Mountains of the Moon  to the  Fingers  and hired a fisherman to bring him to  White Harbor  with a boat. They were caught by a storm on the  Bite  and the fisherman drowned. However, his daughter brought Eddard to the  Three Sisters . When he arrived at  Sisterton ,  House Borrell 's maester urged  Lord Borrell  to deliver Eddard's head to King  Aerys II Targaryen , but Lord Borrell, knowing that Jon Arryn and Robert Baratheon had  taken Gulltown  in the meantime, was unsure who would prevail in the conflict. Thus he let Ned leave for White Harbor, telling him to remain silent about his stay in Sisterton in case the rebellion failed. [31] 
 Eddard called his banners, and marched south to join Robert, arriving with Lord  Hoster Tully  in time to turn the tide at the  Battle of the Bells . [32]  Afterward, he went to  Riverrun  to marry Hoster's elder daughter,  Catelyn , who had been betrothed to his brother  Brandon  before his death. [9]  Jon Arryn married Hoster's younger daughter,  Lysa , in the same ceremony. The double wedding bound  House Tully  to the rebels' cause. [1] 
 The rebels won their decisive victory in the  Battle of the Trident , in which Robert killed Prince  Rhaegar Targaryen  in single combat at the  ruby ford . Because Robert had been wounded by Rhaegar, it fell on Eddard to pursue the remnants of Aerys's armies to  King's Landing . [13] 
 
   Eddard,  Jaime , and  Aerys  in the  Iron Throne  room - by Amok © 
 When Eddard arrived at the capital, Lord  Tywin Lannister 's force had already sacked the city. Eddard had developed contempt for  House Lannister  during the rebellion, as Tywin had remained neutral in an apparent attempt to join the winning side in the end. Eddard's contempt increased when he learned that Tywin had conquered the city by treachery and that his men had brutally killed Rhaegar's wife,  Elia Martell , and children,  Rhaenys  and  Aegon . In addition, Lannister flags were flying over the  Red Keep  when Eddard arrived and, as he rode into the throne room to claim the crown for Robert, he found King Aerys's body at the steps leading to the  Iron Throne , on which the king's killer, Ser  Jaime Lannister , was sitting. [13] 
 Eddard felt the  Sack of King's Landing  dishonored Robert's cause. He was disappointed that Robert, upon arriving in the city, did not share his moral outrage and in particular defended the murder of Rhaegar's children. He also ignored Eddard's counsel that Jaime should be made to join the  Night's Watch  for breaking his oath as a knight of the  Kingsguard  by not protect the king. Their disagreements created a rift between Eddard and Robert that not even Jon Arryn was able to breach. [1] [13] [33] 
 Eddard left Robert in King's Landing and went to  Storm's End , where he lifted the  siege of the castle . Lord  Mace Tyrell  and his armies yielded to Eddard without a fight. [34]  Afterwards, Eddard travelled to the  Red Mountains  of  Dorne  to liberate his sister  Lyanna , who apparently was held at the  tower of joy . When Eddard arrived along with six companions, he found the tower guarded by three members of the Kingsguard,  Arthur Dayne ,  Oswell Whent , and Lord Commander  Gerold Hightower . The resulting  skirmish  saw the deaths of all but Eddard and one companion,  Howland Reed . [35]  Eddard is said to have killed Arthur, the  Sword of the Morning , in single combat. [36] 
 
   Eddard makes a promise to  Lyanna  before her death - by Amok © 
 Unfortunately, when Eddard found Lyanna, she was already dying. [37]  Before her death, she made Eddard promise her something; [37]  what he promised her has not yet been revealed. The experience haunts Eddard and he recalls her  "promise me"  on multiple occasions. [13] [19] [14]  However, the shared grief over Lyanna led to his reconciliation with his friend, now King Robert I. [13] 
 When Eddard returned home to  Winterfell , he brought with him his bastard son,  Jon Snow . This strained the relationship with his wife  Catelyn , who had given birth to their son  Robb  at  Riverrun  during the war. Eddard refused to speak to her about Jon's mother. However, stories concerning her identity circulated nonetheless. When Catelyn heard rumors that the boy's mother was the  Dornish  noblewoman  Ashara Dayne , she confronted Eddard about it, but he told her in a brusque manner that the child was his blood and that was all she needed to know. He subsequently silenced the rumors about Ashara. [9]   Sansa Stark  recalls hearing whispers that Jon's mother was common born. [38]  Lord  Edric Dayne  believes that, rather than his aunt Ashara, Jon Snow's mother was a woman called  Wylla , who worked for  House Dayne  and at one point served as Edric's wet-nurse. [39]  When asked about the mother of his bastard son by King  Robert I Baratheon , Eddard also mentions the name Wylla. [13]  However, Lord  Godric Borrell  claims that the daughter of the fisherman who sneaked Eddard away from the Fingers gave birth to Jon Snow. [31] 
 Eddard buried the bones of his deceased kin in the  crypt of Winterfell . Breaking the tradition of only Stark kings and lords having statues, Ned had them carved for Brandon and Lyanna next to that of Lord Rickard. [28]   Barbrey Dustin , now Lady of  Barrowton , resented that Eddard returned the horse but not the bones of her husband, Lord  Willam , who had died fighting alongside Ned in Dorne. [27]  Ned's younger brother,  Benjen , joined the  Night's Watch . [40] 
 
 Lord of Winterfell 
 As a second son, Eddard had never expected to become the  Lord of Winterfell , and as such did not always feel equal to the task, determined it had all been meant for his elder brother Brandon. [9]  Lord Stark has taken little interest in affairs south of the  Neck . [13] 
 In  289 AC , Eddard travelled south to help Robert suppress  Greyjoy's Rebellion . After the decisive  siege of Pyke  and Lord  Balon Greyjoy 's surrender, Eddard took Balon's only surviving son,  Theon , to Winterfell as a ward and hostage. [37]  While Eddard tried to be like a father to Theon from time to time, [41]  the boy still found Lord Stark to be cold. [41] 
 When Lord  Jorah Mormont  tried to sell poachers he had caught on his lands into  slavery  in  293 AC , Eddard travelled to  Bear Island  to bring him to justice for his crime. Upon arrival, Ned found that Jorah and  Lynesse Hightower  had fled into exile, however. [13] 
 During his marriage to Catelyn, Eddard had five children with her:  Robb ,  Sansa ,  Arya ,  Bran , and  Rickon . [25]  Eddard has taught Robb and  Jon Snow , his bastard son, about command in battle. [42] 
 Arya has visited  White Harbor  twice with her father, [43]  and Theon Greyjoy accompanied Lord Stark during a visit to Ser  Helman Tallhart  at  Torrhen's Square [44]  and several visits to the  Glovers  at  Deepwood Motte . [45]  The  hill clans  have always treated Lord Stark generously when he visited the  northern mountains , [46]  calling him "the Ned". [47]  Eddard hosted Lord  Rickard Karstark  and his daughter,  Alys , when the girl was six. [48]   Mance Rayder  was part of  Lord Commander Qorgyle 's expedition to Winterfell to see Lord Stark. [49]  Eddard is wary of  Roose Bolton , Lord of the  Dreadfort . [50]

[20] [22]  Grand Maester  Pycelle  provides the Hand with  The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms , which Jon had been reading. [20] 
 When news reaches King's Landing that Daenerys is pregnant, Robert holds a council meeting demanding she be put to death. Eddard and Barristan are the only ones to speak out against the move, but Robert, driven by his hatred of the Targaryens, insists on the assassination. Eddard, unwilling to cooperate, resigns his post in protest. [15] 
 Before his planned departure from King's Landing to return to Winterfell, Eddard visits another of Robert's bastard children, a girl named  Barra , found by Lord Baelish. Returning from this meeting he is ambushed by Ser  Jaime Lannister , who wants revenge for the seizure of his brother Tyrion by Catelyn at the  crossroads inn , [22]  a fact Eddard had learned the day before from  Yoren , a  wandering crow . [57] [15]  Eight men [35]  die from the ensuing melee, including  Jory Cassel ,  Heward ,  Wyl , and  Tregar , and Ned's leg is broken when his horse falls upon him.

As Robert lays on his deathbed, Eddard rebuffs both the suggestion of Robert's youngest brother, Lord  Renly Baratheon , that they seize control of the royal children, and Petyr Baelish's urgings to rule as  regent  while Cersei and Jaime's thirteen-year-old son, Prince Joffrey, accedes to the Iron Throne, instead planning to deliver it to the elder of Robert's younger brothers, Lord  Stannis .

 The blood of the  First Men  still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die. [10] —Eddard to  Bran Stark 
 
 
 
 A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is. [10] —Eddard to  Bran Stark

 "If it came to that, the life of some child I did not know, against  Robb  and  Sansa  and  Arya  and  Bran  and  Rickon , what would I do?

 Cersei : You should have taken  the realm  for yourself. It was there for the taking.  Jaime  told me how you found him on the  Iron Throne  the day  King's Landing fell , and made him yield it up. That was your moment. All you needed to do was climb those steps, and sit. Such a sad mistake. Eddard : I have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine, but that was not one of them. [58] — Cersei Lannister  and Eddard

 You wear your honor like a suit of armor, Stark. You think it keeps you safe, but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move. [19] — Petyr Baelish  to Eddard 
 
 
 
 You are an honest and honorable man, Lord Eddard. Ofttimes I forget that. I have met so few of them in my life ... When I see what honesty and honor have won you, I understand why. [14] — Varys  to Eddard 
 
 
 
 Ned Stark a traitor? Not bloody likely. The  Long Summer  will come again before that one would besmirch his precious honor. [17] — Jorah Mormont  to  Quhuru Mo 
 
 
 
 As for your Ned, he should have kissed the hand that killed  Aerys , but he preferred to scorn the arse he found sitting on  Robert's   throne . [29] — Jaime Lannister  to  Catelyn Stark 
 
 
 
 I knew Ned Stark as well. Your father was no friend of mine, but only a fool would doubt his honor or his honesty. [81] — Stannis Baratheon  to  Jon Snow 
 
 
 
 A long time ago, she remembered her father saying that when the cold wind blows the lone wolf dies but the pack survives. He had it all backwards. Arya, the lone wolf, still lived, but the wolves of the pack had been taken and slain and skinned. [82] —thoughts of  Arya Stark 
 
 
 
 Your father was a stubborn man as well. Honor, he called it. Well, honor has its costs, as Lord Eddard learned to his sorrow. [46] — Stannis Baratheon  to  Jon Snow
