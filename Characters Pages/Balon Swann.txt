[6]  The silver brooch which clasps his cloak is decorated with ivory and onyx swans. [3]  Balon is good with a lance, better with a morningstar, and exceptional with a bow. [2] [7] [2]

 A Game of Thrones 
 Ser Balon attends the  Hand's tourney  in  King's Landing . He defeats  Alyn , but is later beaten by Ser  Gregor Clegane . [8]   Anguy  outshoots Balon and  Jalabhar Xho  in the archery competition. [9] 
 Balon participates in the hunt for a hart in the  kingswood  with  Robert I Baratheon . [10]  He returns to the capital before the king is wounded by a boar, however. [11]  Balon is suggested by Lord  Petyr Baelish  as a possible ally for  Eddard Stark ,  Hand of the King , in a power struggle against Queen  Cersei Lannister , but Ned chooses to recruit the  gold cloaks  instead. [12] 
 Balon remains at court after Robert succumbs to his wounds. He warns Ser  Dontos Hollard  about approaching Ned's daughter,  Sansa Stark , when King  Joffrey I Baratheon  holds court. [13] 
 
 A Clash of Kings 
 Ser Balon takes part in the  tourney on King Joffrey's name day , unhorsing  Morros Slynt  in the second tilt of the day. [5]  Sansa hopes that a mysterious note came from Balon, but the ally turns out to be Dontos. [14] 
 During a dinner given by Lady  Tanda Stokeworth , Lord  Gyles Rosby  raises his glass "to the health of the king," and Balon replies that three glasses would be needed (for Joffrey, his uncle  Renly , and  Robb Stark , the new  King in the North ). The joke is meant to raise the spirits of the guests, but Lord  Varys  reports it to  Tyrion Lannister , the acting  Hand of the King . Tyrion decides not to follow up on it as he believes Balon made a harmless jest. [15] 
 Balon supports Joffrey in  King's Landing  during the  War of the Five Kings . His older brother, Ser  Donnel , first serves Renly, but he then joins  Stannis Baratheon  after Renly's death at  Storm's End . Their father, Lord  Gulian Swann , pleads illness while remaining at  Stonehelm . [2] 
 Ser Balon is among the party that sees Princess  Myrcella Baratheon  off to  Dorne , watching the ceremony in the company of Queen  Cersei , and he bears a  Lannister lion  banner alongside the  Baratheon stag  carried by Ser  Aron Santagar . Balon survives  the riot  when the party is attacked by a raging mob. [16]  Balon is chosen for the  Kingsguard  by Cersei to replace Ser  Preston Greenfield , who died in the riot. Tyrion approves of the choice. [2] 
 Tyrion plans for three Kingsguard—Balon, Ser  Mandon Moore , and  Sandor Clegane —to lead sorties during the  Battle of the Blackwater . [17]  Wielding his mace, a gore-spattered Balon leads Lannister forces alongside Tyrion and Mandon. [6]  He makes it back inside the city walls once Stannis's forces overwhelm them temporarily. [18] 
 After the battle, Balon and the other remaining Kingsguard spend hours knighting more than six hundred men. [19]  His brother Donnel kneels to Joffrey. [7] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
 Balon continues to serve in the Kingsguard at the  Red Keep [20]  and  Maegor's Holdfast . [21]  Unlike his new Sworn Brother, Ser  Loras Tyrell , Balon is in attendance when Tyrion marries Sansa. [22] 
 Balon jumps back in alarm when Joffrey first wields  Widow's Wail . [23]  The young king dies at his  wedding feast . [24] 
 When  Steelshanks Walton  and  Brienne of Tarth  escort Ser  Jaime Lannister ,  Lord Commander of the Kingsguard , back to King's landing, Balon intervenes when Loras confronts Brienne and Jaime. [25] 
 Balon is called as the first witness against Tyrion in the death of King Joffrey. Balon praises Tyrion's bravery at the Blackwater and does not believe he killed Joffrey. Balon does admit that Tyrion had struck the king after the  riot of King's Landing . Prince  Oberyn Martell  remarks that Kingsguard of old would have removed Tyrion's hand for striking the royal personage. [26] 
 Jaime notes that Balon is well suited to the white cloak. When the Lord Commander holds a meeting of the Kingsguard, Balon is ashamed for not having prevented Joffrey's death. Balon promises to defend his king even if it were to mean fighting his family. [7]  When Jaime is met by Cersei in  White Sword Tower , Balon is away defending the new king,  Tommen I Baratheon . [27] 
 
 A Feast for Crows 
 Balon stands vigil with Jaime over the corpse of his father, Lord  Tywin Lannister . [28]  He is later assigned by Jaime as Tommen's primary Kingsguard, and he dutifully guards the boy king every morning. [4] 
 Balon is abruptly re-assigned by Queen Regent  Cersei Lannister  to bring  Doran Martell ,  Prince of Dorne , the  skull  of Ser  Gregor Clegane , though Cersei also commands him to carry out another secret assignment. [29] 
 At the  Greenblood , Ser  Arys Oakheart  is killed by  Areo Hotah  and Princess  Myrcella Baratheon  is wounded by Ser  Gerold Dayne . [30]  Doran orders the noble houses of  Dorne  to delay Balon's arrival. The  Wyls  keep him hunting and hawking for eight days on one end of the  Boneway , and he is feasted for a fortnight by the  Yronwoods  at  Yronwood  on the other. Lady  Jordayne  arranges games in his honor at the  Tor , with Lady  Nymella Toland  intent on outdoing her at  Ghost Hill . [31] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Ser Balon arrives at  Sunspear  with three knights, eight squires, twenty men-at-arms, sundry grooms, and servants. [3]  When Balon presents the  Mountain's skull  to Doran Martell at a feast held in his honor, also present are Princess  Arianne Martell ,  Areo Hotah ,  Ellaria Sand , a dozen lords, and three  Sand Snakes ,  Obara ,  Nymeria , and  Tyene . The confident Areo is prepared to fight the knight if need be. Balon tells Tyene of Gregor's death by  poison , which he considers shameful. Balon eats little of the feast and resists the flirtations of Arianne. [3] 
 Balon was previously ordered by Queen Cersei to bring Myrcella back to King's Landing under the guise of visiting her brother, King Tommen. As part of the plan, Doran or a retainer will accompany them to fill the vacant Dornish seat on the  small council  left by Prince  Oberyn Martell , who had been killed by Gregor. Prince  Trystane Martell  is invited as well to see the city. Doran states that traveling by ship might be easier, but an unnerved Balon replies that a voyage by sea would be too dangerous. [3] 
 In a private chamber, Doran reveals to his family that friends in King's Landing informed him that Queen Cersei plans to have the party ambushed during the journey to the capital. The attack will be led by brigands shouting "halfman," and Trystane is to be killed in the fighting. Balon is to falsely claim that he saw  Tyrion Lannister  during the ambush, placing the blame for Trystane's death on Tyrion. Balon's aversion to Doran's suggestion of a trip by sea proves Doran's suspicions. Doran states that though Balon does not like his orders, he is compelled to obey. Obera is willing to kill the Kingsguard, but Doran refuses because of  guest right . [3] 
 To stop Cersei's scheme from coming to fruition, Doran has Myrcella meet Balon at the  Water Gardens  and lie about the Greenblood, placing responsibility for her wounds and the death of Arys Oakheart solely on Ser  Gerold Dayne . Obara will then lead Balon to Gerold's seat in western Dorne,  High Hermitage . [3]  Balon sends a letter informing King's Landing of Myrcella's claims, [32]  and he hunts for the rogue knight Darkstar. [33] 
 
 Quotes by Balon 
 Jaime : It's not Ser  Donnel the Constant  who concerns me. It's you. What will you do if brave Ser Donnel gives his sword to yet another usurper, and one day comes storming into  the throne room ? And there you stand all in white, between  your king  and  your blood . What will you do? 
 Balon : I ... my lord, that will never happen. 
 Jaime :  It happened to me . 
 
 Balon : My lord. On my sword, on my honor, on  my father's  name, I swear ... I shall not do as you did. [7] 
  –  Jaime Lannister  and Balon
 
 
 Nymeria : Ser  Gregor  was a bloody brute, all men agree. If ever a man deserved to suffer, it was him. 
 Balon : That is as it may be, my lady, but Ser Gregor was a  knight , and a knight should die with sword in hand.  Poison  is a foul and filthy way to kill. [3] 
  –  Nymeria Sand  and Balon
 Quotes about Balon 
 He would serve with honor and courage. [2] 
  – thoughts of  Tyrion Lannister 
 
 
 His two white shadows were always with him; Balon Swann and  Mandon Moore , beautiful in their pale plate. Surrounded by a circle of  Velaryon  spearmen, they fought back to back; they made battle as graceful as a dance. [6] 
  – thoughts of  Tyrion Lannister 
 
 
 This one is not so easily seduced as was his Sworn Brother, Hotah thought. Ser  Arys  was a boy, despite his years. This one is a man, and wary. [3] 
  – thoughts of  Areo Hotah 
 
 
 Nymeria : This is monstrous. I would not have believed it, not of a  Kingsguard   knight . 
 Doran : They are sworn to obey, just as  my captain  is. [3] 
  –  Nymeria Sand  and  Doran Martell
