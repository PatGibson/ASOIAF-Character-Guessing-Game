[5] Sansa hopes that a mysterious note came from Balon, but the ally turns out to be Dontos. [14]  During a dinner given by Lady Tanda Stokeworth , Lord Gyles Rosby raises his glass "to the health of the king," and Balon replies that three glasses would be needed (for Joffrey, his uncle Renly , and Robb Stark , the new King in the North ). The joke is meant to raise the spirits of the guests, but Lord Varys reports it to Tyrion Lannister , the acting Hand of the King . Tyrion decides not to follow up on it as he believes Balon made a harmless jest. [15]  Balon supports Joffrey in King's Landing during the War of the Five Kings . His older brother, Ser Donnel , first serves Renly, but he then joins Stannis Baratheon after Renly's death at Storm's End . Their father, Lord Gulian Swann , pleads illness while remaining at Stonehelm . [2]  Ser Balon is among the party that sees Princess Myrcella Baratheon off to Dorne , watching the ceremony in the company of Queen Cersei , and he bears a Lannister lion banner alongside the Baratheon stag carried by Ser Aron Santagar . Balon survives the riot when the party is attacked by a raging mob. [16] Balon is chosen for the Kingsguard by Cersei to replace Ser Preston Greenfield , who died in the riot.

[23] The young king dies at his wedding feast . [24]  When Steelshanks Walton and Brienne of Tarth escort Ser Jaime Lannister , Lord Commander of the Kingsguard , back to King's landing, Balon intervenes when Loras confronts Brienne and Jaime. [25]  Balon is called as the first witness against Tyrion in the death of King Joffrey. Balon praises Tyrion's bravery at the Blackwater and does not believe he killed Joffrey. Balon does admit that Tyrion had struck the king after the riot of King's Landing . Prince Oberyn Martell remarks that Kingsguard of old would have removed Tyrion's hand for striking the royal personage. [26]  Jaime notes that Balon is well suited to the white cloak. When the Lord Commander holds a meeting of the Kingsguard, Balon is ashamed for not having prevented Joffrey's death. Balon promises to defend his king even if it were to mean fighting his family. [7] When Jaime is met by Cersei in White Sword Tower , Balon is away defending the new king, Tommen I Baratheon . [27]   A Feast for Crows  Balon stands vigil with Jaime over the corpse of his father, Lord Tywin Lannister . [28] He is later assigned by Jaime as Tommen's primary Kingsguard, and he dutifully guards the boy king every morning. [4]  Balon is abruptly re-assigned by Queen Regent Cersei Lannister to bring Doran Martell , Prince of Dorne , the skull of Ser Gregor Clegane , though Cersei also commands him to carry out another secret assignment. [29]  At the Greenblood , Ser Arys Oakheart is killed by Areo Hotah and Princess Myrcella Baratheon is wounded by Ser Gerold Dayne . [30] Doran orders the noble houses of Dorne to delay Balon's arrival. The Wyls keep him hunting and hawking for eight days on one end of the Boneway , and he is feasted for a fortnight by the Yronwoods at Yronwood on the other. Lady Jordayne arranges games in his honor at the Tor , with Lady Nymella Toland intent on outdoing her at Ghost Hill . [31]   A Dance with Dragons  Ser Balon arrives at Sunspear with three knights, eight squires, twenty men-at-arms, sundry grooms, and servants. [3] When Balon presents the Mountain's skull to Doran Martell at a feast held in his honor, also present are Princess Arianne Martell , Areo Hotah , Ellaria Sand , a dozen lords, and three Sand Snakes , Obara , Nymeria , and Tyene . The confident Areo is prepared to fight the knight if need be. Balon tells Tyene of Gregor's death by poison , which he considers shameful. Balon eats little of the feast and resists the flirtations of Arianne. [3]  Balon was previously ordered by Queen Cersei to bring Myrcella back to King's Landing under the guise of visiting her brother, King Tommen. As part of the plan, Doran or a retainer will accompany them to fill the vacant Dornish seat on the small council left by Prince Oberyn Martell , who had been killed by Gregor. Prince Trystane Martell is invited as well to see the city. Doran states that traveling by ship might be easier, but an unnerved Balon replies that a voyage by sea would be too dangerous. [3]  In a private chamber, Doran reveals to his family that friends in King's Landing informed him that Queen Cersei plans to have the party ambushed during the journey to the capital. The attack will be led by brigands shouting "halfman," and Trystane is to be killed in the fighting. Balon is to falsely claim that he saw Tyrion Lannister during the ambush, placing the blame for Trystane's death on Tyrion. Balon's aversion to Doran's suggestion of a trip by sea proves Doran's suspicions. Doran states that though Balon does not like his orders, he is compelled to obey. Obera is willing to kill the Kingsguard, but Doran refuses because of guest right . [3]  To stop Cersei's scheme from coming to fruition, Doran has Myrcella meet Balon at the Water Gardens and lie about the Greenblood, placing responsibility for her wounds and the death of Arys Oakheart solely on Ser Gerold Dayne . Obara will then lead Balon to Gerold's seat in western Dorne, High Hermitage . [3] Balon sends a letter informing King's Landing of Myrcella's claims, [32] and he hunts for the rogue knight Darkstar.
