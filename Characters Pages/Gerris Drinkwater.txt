 Recent Events 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Ser Gerris accompanies Prince  Quentyn Martell  on his mission to wed  Daenerys Targaryen . They are forced to fend off  corsairs  when the  Meadowlark  is attacked near the  Disputed Lands . [3] 
 When they reach  Volantis , Gerris pretends to be a wine merchant looking for a ship to take him and his two servants to  Meereen , where Daenerys has become queen. The only captain to accept them is the master of  Adventure , but the  Dornishmen  fear he will betray them. [3]  Posing as poor exiles, they instead join the  Windblown , who have been hired by  Yunkai  for the  second siege of Meereen . [1]  Having sold their fine armor in Volantis, the Dornish receive used equipment from the Windblown, with Gerris's inferior to that of his companions, Quentyn and Ser  Archibald Yronwood . Among the  sellswords  Gerris is known as Dornish Gerrold or Drink, after Archibald accidentally calls him that. [1] 
 The Windblown sail from Volantis and fight new  Unsullied  in the  siege of Astapor . [1]  The three  Westerosi  plan to desert after they reach Yunkai, but the  Tattered Prince , the commander of the Windblown, summons them with other exiles from the  Seven Kingdoms  or sellswords of  Westerosi  descent. The Tattered Prince tasks the group of twenty with turning their cloak from Yunkai and joining the service of Daenerys. With this move the Tattered Prince wants to make sure that if the siege turns unfortunate he will be still on the winning side. [1] 
 Once the Dornishmen reach Meereen [8]  and present themselves to Daenerys, Gerris is the first one to say his real name. He becomes angry when  Daario Naharis  mocks Quentyn, and the knight unsuccessfully tries to convince Daenerys not to wed  Hizdahr zo Loraq . [5]  The Dornishmen attend Hizdahr's feast but are seated far from the king. Quentyn refuses Daenerys's suggestion that he leave Meereen. [9] 
 After Daenerys flees from  Daznak's Pit  atop  Drogon , [10]  Ser  Barristan Selmy  considers that his queen may not have wed Hizdahr if Gerris had been the Dornish prince instead of the less handsome Quentyn. Barristan advises the three Dornishmen to return to Westeros and forget about the  secret marriage pact , but Gerris, who is unafraid of Hizdahr, turns down the advice of the old knight. [6] 
 Quentyn hopes that since he has partial  House Targaryen  ancestry, he will be able to tame at least one of Daenerys's  dragons , two of which are imprisoned in the  Great Pyramid . Although Gerris tries to dissuade the prince, Quentyn is determined. In return for  Pentos , the Tattered Prince agrees to have the Windblown aid Quentyn. [11] 
 Gerris saves Quentyn from a guard's spear when the Dornishmen and Windblown infiltrate the Great Pyramid. When Quentyn attempts to tame  Viserion , Gerris and Archibald try to warn him of the other dragon,  Rhaegal , whose  flame  burns the prince. [12]  The Windblown flee, but Gerris and Archibald are arrested by  Brazen Beasts . Gerris is so shocked by what happened with his prince that he drops his sword the moment the guards appear. Quentyn succumbs to his wounds after three days. [7] 
 Since Rhaegal and Viserion have been set loose,  Symon Stripeback  and  Skahaz mo Kandaq  want Gerris and Archibald to be hanged while the  Spotted Cat  wants to slay them in the  fighting pits of Meereen . [7]  When Barristan comes to see the Dornish prisoners, Gerris blames Daenerys for what had happened with Quentyn, saying that her actions forced the prince to risk his life in order to win her. Barristan tells them that they are to be hanged but he could instead arrange a ship for them to take Quentyn's bones to  Dorne . In return, the  Hand of the Queen  wants the Dornishmen to inform the Tattered Prince that Barristan will pay his price of Pentos if the hostages in the Yunkish camp are returned to Meereen. Although Gerris is skeptical, Archibald accepts for both of them. [7] 
 
 Quotes by Gerris 
 Men's lives have meaning, not their deaths. [11] 
  - Gerris to  Quentyn Martell 
 
 
 Men may be found of maidens, but women like a man who knows what he's about in the bedchamber. It's another sort of sword-play. Takes training to be good at it. [12] 
  - Gerris to  Quentyn Martell 
 
 
 I told him it was folly. I begged him to go home. Your  bitch of a queen  had no use for him, any man could see that. He crossed the world to offer her his love and fealty, and she laughed in his face. [7] 
  - Gerris to  Barristan Selmy 
 Quotes about Gerris 
 It was not in Gerris Drinkwater's nature to imagine they might fail, let alone that they might die. [3] 
  - thoughts of  Quentyn Martell 
 
 
 That smile has won many a maiden's heart, I'll wager. [5] 
  - thoughts of  Daenerys Targaryen 
 
 
 If this one had been the prince, things might have gone elsewise, he could not help but think ... but there was something a bit too pleasant about Drinkwater for his taste. False coin, the old knight thought. He had known such men before. [6] 
  - thoughts of  Barristan Selmy
