 Quotes by Alester 
 Alester:  You know me for a man of honor— 
 Cortnay:  I know you for a man of ambition, a man who changes kings and gods the way I change my boots. [3] 
  – Alester and  Cortnay Penrose 
 
 
 My chests were lost when the  Lannisters  overran our camp. I escaped with no more than the mail on my back and the rings on my fingers. No doubt some cook’s boy or groom is prancing around  King’s Landing  just now in my slashed velvet doublet and jeweled cloak. But war has its horrors, as all men know. [2] 
  - Alester to  Davos Seaworth 
 
 
 Stannis Baratheon  will never sit the  Iron Throne . Is it treason to say the truth? A bitter truth, but no less true for that. [2] 
  - Alester to  Davos Seaworth 
 
 
 Not treason. Never treason. I love  His Grace  as much as any man. My own  niece  is his queen, and I remained loyal to him when wiser men fled. I am his  Hand , the  Hand of the King , how can I be a traitor? [2] 
  - Alester to  Davos Seaworth
