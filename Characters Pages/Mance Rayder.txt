 History 
   Mance Rayder by graikfaik © 
 According to  Selyse Florent , Mance's parents were a common woman of the  free folk  and a man of the  Night's Watch . [10]  After a group of raiders were put to the sword when Mance was a child, he was taken by the Night's Watch and raised as one of them. [6]  According to a semi-canon source, his last name of "Rayder" comes from this origin. [11] 
 A  ranger  of the  Shadow Tower , Mance often sang of  Bael the Bard  after returning from rangings  beyond the Wall . [6]  When  Lord Commander Qorgyle  traveled to  Winterfell  to meet with Lord  Eddard Stark , Mance rode escort and met the young  Robb Stark  and  Jon Snow . [3] 
 Mance was attacked by a  shadowcat  while ranging, and was healed by a wildling woman. While he recuperated, she mended his torn cloak with swatches of red fabric. Upon returning to the  Wall , Ser  Denys Mallister  required Mance to replace his mended cloak with one of uniform black. This infringement of freedom caused Mance to abandon the Shadow Tower [6]  and live with the  free folk  in the way he wished. [3] 
 Mance spent years gaining gathering various tribes into one host, seeking support from clan mothers and  magnars . He made peace between  Harma Dogshead  and the  Lord of Bones , the  Hornfoots  and the  Nightrunners , and the  men of the Frozen Shore  and the  ice-river clans . [8]  Opposed by five other would-be  Kings-Beyond-the-Wall , Mance gained the support of  Tormund  of  Ruddy Hall  and  Styr  of  Thenn  and slew the three rivals who refused to submit. [9]

 A Game of Thrones

 Hearing of King  Robert I Baratheon 's planned visit to  Winterfell  to see Lord  Eddard Stark  via sources in the  Night's Watch , Mance, inspired by the legend of  Bael the Bard , decided to partake in the event. He scales the  Wall  near  Long Barrow , purchases a horse south of the  New Gift , and journeys to Winterfell. [3] 
 Mance's presence is unbeknownst to both Eddard, who does not remember Mance from his previous visit with  Lord Commander Qorgyle , and  Benjen Stark , who had never met Mance despite being in the Watch for a few years. Under the disguise of a musician, Mance plays the lute during the feast for Robert. He meets  Dalla  during his return to the lands  beyond the Wall . [3] 
 Osha  suggests capturing  Bran Stark  in the  wolfswood  and delivering him as a hostage to Mance, but Osha is instead captured by  House Stark . [12] 
 A captured wildling tells  Qhorin Halfhand  that Mance is gathering wildlings to a secret stronghold. [13] 
 
 A Clash of Kings 
 Following the rumors about Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, and the wildlings deserting their villages, the Night's Watch assembles in force in a  great ranging   beyond the Wall . [14]   Craster  informs  Jeor Mormont ,  Lord Commander of the Night's Watch , that Mance is gathering wildlings in the  Frostfangs . Jeor fears that Mance intends to strike south against the  Seven Kingdoms . [15] 
 Mance sends  Alfyn Crowkiller  to scout along the Wall, but he is slain by Qhorin's men. [16] 
 
 A Storm of Swords

 Mance has his followers dig in graves along the  Milkwater [17]  in search of the legendary  Horn of Winter , said to be capable of toppling the  Wall , but the horn is not found. [18] 
 When  Jon Snow  meets with Mance in the Frostfangs under pretext of joining his campaign, the bard sings " The Dornishman's Wife ". Jon mistakes the more distinctive  Tormund  and  Styr  as Mance. [3]  Mance sends Styr to climb the Wall and  attack Castle Black  from the south. [19]  He sends Jon with Styr's group, [8]  but Jon escapes at  Queenscrown  and manages to warn the black brothers about the upcoming attack. [20] 
 After Styr's attack fails, [21]  Mance  attacks the Wall  with his main force. Despite his better numbers, the Night's Watch under command of Jon Snow are successful in keeping Mance's forces at bay. [22] [23]  Aware of the low numbers of the Night's Watch, Mance eventually sends a request for a parley to Castle Black, requesting an envoy is sent to him. Ser  Alliser Thorne  and  Janos Slynt  send Jon, secretly tasking with assassinating the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Displaying a huge horn in his tent, Mance threatens to use the Horn of Winter if he is not allowed to pass through the gate. However, Mance reveals that the free folk, including his own people, have been hunted by the  Others  and their  wights , and are unable to stop them. His true aim therefore is not to destroy the Wall, but to use it as a shield against the Others. [9]  During their parley,  rangers  from  Eastwatch-by-the-Sea  and the southern force of  Stannis Baratheon  unexpectedly arrive. Although Mance personally leads a wedge of mounted free folk against them, the disorganized free folk army breaks once Mance's horse goes down. [9]  Mance's wife,  Dalla , goes into labor during the battle [9]  and dies giving birth to  their son . [24]  Mance himself is captured by Stannis and held captive at Castle Black, where his wounds are treated by Maester  Aemon . [25]  Stannis Baratheon speaks with him, but feels he has no other choice but to sacrifice Mance to  R'hllor [24]  once he is strong enough. [25]  At Castle Black, Mance's son is given over to  Val , Dalla's sister, while the girl  Gilly  serves as his wetnurse. [25]  Val requests to be allowed to see Mance and let him hold his son once. [25]  Jon Snow presents the request to Stannis Baratheon, but is denied. [24] 
 
 A Feast for Crows 
 Fearing that  Stannis Baratheon  will allow his  red priestess ,  Melisandre , to sacrifice Mance's son in the believe that Mance's title of "King-Beyond-the-Wall" could be construed as his child having royal blood,  Jon Snow , the new  Lord Commander of the Night's Watch , sends  Gilly  away from Castle Black and forces her to leave her own son behind and secretly take Mance's son instead. [26] [27]   Gilly  later suggests the name  Aemon Steelsong  for Mance's son. [28] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons

 Mance is supposedly burned alive by Stannis with surrendered free folk, members of the Night's Watch,  king's men , and  queen's men  there to bear witness.  Jon Snow  orders him killed by archers of the Watch during the burning to give him a quick death. [29]  In actuality the man killed is  Rattleshirt , who is glamoured by  Melisandre 's magic to appear like Mance. Meanwhile, the actual Mance is glamored by a ruby worn at his wrist to appear as Rattleshirt. Sparring with "Rattleshirt" in the yard of Castle Black, Jon is shocked by the man's speed and skill, not knowing he is actually Mance. [2] 
 Later when word reaches the  Wall  that  Arya Stark  is to wed  Ramsay Bolton , Melisandre offers to send "Rattleshirt" to retrieve her, but Jon refuses, not trusting the Lord of Bones. Melisandre reveals Mance's disguise to make Jon reconsider the offer. Jon holds Mance's son so Mance would do everything in his power to rescue Jon's sister for the sake of his son. However, Mance does not know that Jon has switched  Mance's son  with  Gilly's son . [5] 
 No longer appearing as Rattleshirt, the brown-bearded [4]  Mance takes six free folk  spearwives  with him to  Winterfell : [30]   Rowan ,  Holly ,  Squirrel ,  Willow Witch-eye ,  Frenya , and  Myrtle . He arrives at Winterfell as a bard under the assumed name  Abel , [7]  an anagram for " Bael ", and claims the women are camp followers and relatives to him. [31]  Mance performs throughout the wedding and subsequent feasts at Winterfell. [7] [31] [32]  His songs include " Two Hearts That Beat as One ", [7]  " Fair Maids of Summer " [7] , "The Dornishman's Wife", [31]  " Iron Lances ", [32]  " The Winter Maid ", [32]  " The Queen Took Off Her Sandal, the King Took Off His Crown ", [32]  " The Bear and the Maiden Fair ", [32]  " The Maids That Bloom in Spring ", [32]  and an unnamed sad song. [4] 
 With Winterfell snowbound from a blizzard, Mance's spearwives kill several northern men. Suspicion is cast on  Theon Greyjoy  at first, then  Manderly  knights, causing tension in the castle between  Boltons , other northern houses, and  Freys . They also receive the help of a reluctant and fearful Theon to help them free "Arya", though he knows she is really  Jeyne Poole . Tensions explode in the castle when  Little Walder Frey  is murdered, though the spearwives claim it was not their doing. Theon assists Mance's spearwives in rescuing Jeyne, but when Jeyne gives their position away by screaming, Theon and Jeyne are forced to jump from Winterfell's battlements to the snow below. [32] [4] [33] 
 It is reported in a  letter  to Jon purportedly from Ramsay Bolton that Mance has been captured. Ramsay claims Mance has been thrown in a cage which is exposed to the elements and that the six spearwives that came with him have been killed and skinned. Mance is allegedly being forced to use their sewn-together skins in the cage, as it is his only source of warmth. [10] 
 
 Quotes by Mance 
   Mance Rayder - by artist Diego Gisbert Llorens © Fantasy Flight Games. 
 The  Wall  can stop an army, but not a man alone. [3] 
  - Mance to  Jon Snow 
 
 
 I know every bawdy song that's ever been made, north or south of the  Wall . [3] 
  - Mance to  Jon Snow 
 
 
 The Halfhand  was carved of old oak, but I am made of flesh, and I have a great fondness for the charms of women ... which makes me no different from three-quarters of  the Watch . [3] 
  - Mance to  Jon Snow 
 
 
 Jon : Are you a true king? 
 Mance : I've never had a crown on my head or sat my arse on a bloody throne, if that's what you're asking. My birth is as low as a man's can get, no  septon 's ever smeared my head with oils, I don't own any castles, and  my queen  wears furs and amber, not silk and sapphires. I am my own champion, my own fool, and my own harpist. [9] 
  -  Jon Snow  and Mance
 
 
 Free folk  don't follow names, or little cloth animals sewn on a tunic. They won't dance for coins, they don't care how you style yourself or what that chain of office means or who your grandsire was. They follow strength. They follow the man. [34] 
  - Mance to  Jon Snow 
 Quotes about Mance 
 Mance thinks he'll fight, the brave sweet stubborn man, like the  white walkers  were no more than  rangers , but what does he know? He can call himself  King-beyond-the-Wall  all he likes, but he's still just another old  black crow  who flew down from the  Shadow Tower . He's never tasted winter. [35] 
  -  Osha  to  Bran Stark 
 
 
 I knew Mance Rayder, Jon. He is an oathbreaker, yes ... but he has eyes to see, and no man has ever dared to name him faintheart. [15] 
  -  Jeor Mormont  to  Jon Snow 
 
 
 He was the best of  us , and the worst as well. [36] 
  -  Qhorin Halfhand , to  Jon Snow 
 
 
 Mance has cunning. He was raised  a crow , you know, and the crow's a tricksy bird. [3] 
  -  Tormund , to  Jon Snow 
 
 
 The king was plainly a man who liked the sound of his own voice. [3] 
  - thoughts of  Jon Snow 
 
 
 No pain Theon had ever known came close to the agony that  Skinner  could evoke with a little flensing blade. Abel would learn that lesson soon enough. And for what?  Jeyne , her name is Jeyne, and her eyes are the wrong color. A mummer playing a part.  Lord Bolton  knows, and  Ramsay , but the rest are blind, even this bloody bard with his sly smiles. The jape is on you, Abel, you and  your murdering whores . You'll die for the wrong girl. [4] 
  - thoughts of  Theon Greyjoy 
 
 
 Abel had doomed them. All singers were half-mad. In songs, the hero always saved the maiden from the monster's castle, but life was not a song, no more than  Jeyne  was  Arya Stark . [4] 
  - thoughts of  Theon Greyjoy
