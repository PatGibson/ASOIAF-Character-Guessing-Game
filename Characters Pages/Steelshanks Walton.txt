 Quotes by Walton 
 Jaime : Unless you take me back to  Harrenhal , the song I sing  my father  may not be one the Lord of the  Dreadfort  would wish to hear.

[5] — Jaime Lannister  and Walton 
 
 Quotes about Walton 
 Steelshanks, he is called. A soldier of iron loyalty. [2] — Roose Bolton  to  Jaime Lannister 
 
 
 
 Steelshanks Walton commanded Jaime's escort; blunt, brusque, brutal, at heart a simple soldier. Jaime had served with his sort all his life. Men like Walton would kill at their  lord 's command, rape when their blood was up after battle, and plunder wherever they could, but once the war was done they would go back to their homes, trade their spears for hoes, wed their neighbors' daughters, and raise a pack of squalling children. Such men obeyed without question, but the deep malignant cruelty of the  Brave Companions  was not a part of their nature. [5] —thoughts of  Jaime Lannister
