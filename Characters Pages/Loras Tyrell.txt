[1] [8] His hair is a mass of lazy brown curls [1] and ringlets [9] which tumble over his eyes, [10] which have been described as brown, [11] liquid gold, [1] big, [9] and intelligent and lively. [8]  Tyrion Lannister thinks Loras is beautiful and already a legend, and that half the girls in the Seven Kingdoms want to bed him and all the boys want to be him. [12]  Sansa Stark also thinks Loras is beautiful, and that he is lithe and graceful with wonderful eyes. [13]  Loras is beloved by the smallfolk , especially women. While courteous he is still thirsty for glory and can be short-tempered and impetuous. Tyrion finds him a prickly lad. [12]  Oberyn Martell does not believe that Loras is as good a warrior as he is a tourney jouster. [4] According to semi-canon source, Loras is in love with Renly Baratheon , [14] and Loras's father, Lord Mace , and grandmother, Lady Olenna , are aware of his sexuality. [15] Loras is Mace's favorite son. [16]  Despite his youth and slender frame, Loras is a capable warrior, using axes, lances, morningstars, and swords to deadly effect. [8] [17] Loras's silver armor, which is decorated with sapphires and twining black vines, [18] was made by Tobho Mott . [19] He also uses silver mail and a green shield. [8] Golden roses decorate the crest of his helm. [8] Loras wears a cloak of forget-me-nots sewn to a heavy woolen cape. [18] His horses include a speedy grey mare [18] and a tall white stallion. [8]   History  Loras was born at Highgarden [6] in 282 AC . [5] He has two older brothers, Willas and Ser Garlan , and one younger sister, Margaery . Loras squired for Lord Renly Baratheon at Storm's End , [11] [20] and grew close to him. He soon became Renly's lover. [6] At the young age of fifteen, Loras received his knighthood . [6]  Loras purchased his armor from Tobho Mott 's shop in the Street of Steel in King's Landing . [19] During the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day in 298 AC , Loras defeated Ser Hosteen Frey [3] and Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard in the joust. [21] Renly's brother, King Robert I Baratheon , won a Valyrian steel dagger from Loras's victory. [22]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones   Loras participating in the Hand's tourney in Game of Thrones .  Loras participates in the Hand's tourney , wearing armor wrought with jeweled flowers and a cape of woven roses. Amongst his victories are Ser Robar Royce and three members of the Kingsguard . With each victory, he hands a white rose to a pretty girl in the crowd. He then hands a red rose to Sansa Stark , who is overwhelmed by his gallantry and is thereafter infatuated with him. [1] Although reputed to be gallant, Loras rides a mare in heat against Ser Gregor Clegane , noted as an underhanded tactic by some. This inflames the huge knight's stallion, which bucks him, prompting Gregor to attack Loras. After Sandor Clegane comes to his rescue, Loras forfeits the final round to the Hound . [1]  Renly Baratheon and Loras secretly plot to have Renly's eldest brother, King Robert I Baratheon , spurn Queen Cersei Lannister in favor of Loras's sister, Margaery . [23] Renly approaches Lord Eddard Stark with a painting of the girl in hopes that she resembles Eddard's late sister, Lyanna , but this is not the case. [19]  When Eddard, sitting the Iron Throne in Robert's stead as the Hand of the King , sends a party led by Lord Beric Dondarrion to capture or kill Gregor Clegane, Loras is disappointed at not having been chosen instead of Beric. [24]  Loras is mentioned by Petyr Baelish as a possible ally for Lord Stark against Cersei in the succession crisis after Robert's death, but Ned decides it is the City Watch he must have. When Renly flees King's Landing after Lord Stark spurns his request for aid in seizing power, Loras rides south out of the city with him, along with fifty retainers. Varys suspects they ride for either Storm's End or Highgarden . [25] After Joffrey Baratheon is crowned in the power struggle they fled from, both Loras and Renly are named among the nobles he demands must swear fealty to him or stand accused of treason. [26]  Renly weds Margaery at Highgarden and claims the Iron Throne with the support of Lord Mace Tyrell and his sons. [27]   A Clash of Kings   Renly Baratheon and Loras - by Sir-Heartsalot ©.  Loras's father, Lord Mace Tyrell , serves as Hand of the King to Renly Baratheon . [28] Their army gathers at Highgarden, and Renly makes Loras the head of his Rainbow Guard , an ostentatious version of the traditional Kingsguard . The two remain inseparable even after Renly's wedding. During his march, Renly holds a great melee at Bitterbridge of one hundred sixteen knights. Wielding a longaxe, Loras is one of the final two combatants, losing to Brienne of Tarth , who is given the last place in his Rainbow Guard. [8]  After his failed parley with his elder brother, Stannis , at Storm's End , Renly appoints Loras to lead the vanguard in the coming battle, choosing him over Lord Randyll Tarly , Ser Guyard Morrigen , and many other candidates. [29] When the bannermen leave Renly's pavilion, the king asks Loras to stay and help him pray. [30] Later, after Renly's death at the hands of a shadow assassin , [30] Loras goes berserk, killing Ser Emmon Cuy and Ser Robar Royce , the two Rainbow Guard in charge of protecting Renly that morning, as well as another guard. [31]  With Renly dead, Joffrey I Baratheon's small council expects Loras to return to Margaery at Bitterbridge. Lord Petyr Baelish is dispatched to Bitterbridge to seek an alliance. [31] Stannis sends Ser Parmen Crane and Ser Erren Florent to recruit Renly's infantry at Bitterbridge, [32] but they are captured by the Tyrells. [33]  Petyr travels to Bitterbridge and then Highgarden, where he negotiates an alliance between Houses Tyrell and Baratheon . [34] Meanwhile, riders from Bitterbridge inform Lord Tywin Lannister , who rendezvouses with Mace's army. [35] Loras participates in the defeat Stannis by the Lannisters and Tyrells in the Battle of the Blackwater . [36] Afterward Joffrey agrees to wed Renly's widow, Margaery, and Loras is granted a place in the Kingsguard. [37]   A Storm of Swords  Loras joins the Kingsguard at the behest of his father, Lord Mace Tyrell , to protect his sister, Margaery , when she becomes the queen. [38] The appointment also allows Loras to avoid marriage, a prospect complicated by his ambiguous sexuality, and his continued mourning for Renly. Loras quickly becomes popular with the citizens of King's Landing . When Tyrion asks him why he chose to join the Kingsguard at only seventeen, Loras explains that he is a third son and that "When the sun has set , no candle can replace it." [12]  Sansa Stark thinks Loras looks even finer in the white of the Kingsguard than in the greens and golds of House Tyrell . The only spot of color on him now is a brooch that clasps his cloak, the rose of Highgarden wrought in soft yellow gold, nestled in a bed of delicate green jade leaves. The grip of his sword is white leather and its pommel is a rose in alabaster. [13] During her wedding celebrations with Tyrion Lannister , Sansa is asked to dance by Loras's brother, Ser Garlan . Although Sansa is unhappy to marry the Imp, Garlan tells her Tyrion would be a better husband than Loras. [39]  Loras attends the wedding of Joffrey and his sister, Margaery Tyrell . After Joffrey dies from poison during his wedding feast , Queen Cersei Lannister orders the Kingsguard to arrest Tyrion. [40]  When Ser Jaime Lannister , absentee Lord Commander of the Kingsguard , returns to King's Landing , Loras recognizes Brienne of Tarth among his companions and confronts her immediately about Renly's mysterious death. At his request, Jaime has Brienne arrested. [41] During the Kingsguard meeting in the White Sword Tower , Loras blames Sansa, who has disappeared from the capital, for Joffrey's poisoning. [11] Loras reveals to Jaime that his brother, Garlan the Gallant, wore Renly's famous armor and impersonated the fallen king at the Battle of the Blackwater , since Renly's armor was too large to fit Loras. [11] Loras also reveals he buried Renly in a place they knew from when he was a squire at Storm's End . Loras agrees to question and judge Brienne fairly. [11] Loras confronts Brienne and becomes more accepting of her innocence in the death of Renly. [42] Loras laughs during the trial of Tyrion. [43]  At the Fingers , Petyr Baelish tells Sansa that during his negotiations with the Tyrells at Highgarden, he planted the idea of Loras joining the Kingsguard. [34]   A Feast for Crows   The Knight of Flowers - by Felicia Cano ©.  Loras stands vigil with Ser Jaime Lannister over the corpse of Lord Tywin Lannister . [44] Jaime later notices Loras skillfully training and tries to educate the youth about historical Kingsguard . [44] Cersei objects to Loras's offer to train young King Tommen I Baratheon in the ways of an armed knight. [20] When Jaime departs to bring order to the riverlands , he wants Loras to command in his stead in King's Landing, which upsets Cersei. [45] King Tommen is impressed with Loras's actions and demeanor, and the knight spends much of his time with his sister, Queen Margaery . [46]  After the taking of the Shields by the ironborn , Cersei refuses to allow the Redwyne fleet to depart the siege of Dragonstone and deal with Euron Greyjoy , King of the Isles and the North . Loras volunteers to take command and hasten the siege. [47] Three thousand smallfolk , mostly women, see Loras off when he sails to Dragonstone aboard the new dromonds of Lord Aurane Waters . [48]  Aurane tells Cersei that Loras has taken Dragonstone. After Stannis's castellan, Ser Rolland Storm , declined Loras's offer of single combat, Loras led the assault on the castle. The reported victory is said to have been needlessly bloodthirsty and true to Cersei's hopes, it is reported that Loras was horribly injured by quarrels, maces, and boiling oil in the battle. [48]   A Dance with Dragons  Ser Loras is reportedly gravely injured at Dragonstone . The last report that the imprisoned Cersei received was that he had been dying of his wounds received whilst taking the castle. [49] Lord Mace Tyrell tells Ser Kevan Lannister , Tommen's Lord Regent , that his son's men searched Dragonstone and did not find gold, gemstones, or dragon eggs . [50]   Quotes by Loras  Loras : Lord Eddard, what of me?  Eddard : No one doubts your valor, Ser Loras, but we are about justice here, and what you seek is vengeance. [24]  – Loras and Eddard Stark    I will defend King Tommen with all my strength, I swear it. I will give my life for his if need be. But I will never betray Renly , by word or deed. He was the king that should have been. He was the best of them . [11]  – Loras to Jaime Lannister    Give me the command, Your Grace. The castle will be yours within a fortnight if I have to tear it down with my bare hands. [47]  – Loras to Cersei Lannister  Quotes about Loras  Have you seen Mace Tyrell 's boy? The Knight of Flowers, they call him. Now there's a son any man would be proud to own to. Last tourney , he dumped the Kingslayer on his golden rump, you ought to have seen the look on Cersei’s face. I laughed till my sides hurt. [18]   – Robert I Baratheon to Eddard Stark    He's me. I am speaking to myself, as I was, all cocksure arrogance and empty chivalry. This is what it does to you, to be too good too young. [11]   – Jaime Lannister 's thoughts   Under all his flowers and finery, Ser Loras is as hot tempered as Jaime Lannister . Toss Joffrey , Margaery and Loras into a pot, and you've got the makings for Kingslayer stew. [34]   – Petyr Baelish to Sansa Stark    Ser Loras might be as pretty as a maiden's dream, but underneath his white cloak he was Tyrell to the bone. [51]   – Cersei Lannister 's thoughts   The Knight of Flowers was still half a boy, arrogant and vain, but he had it in him to be great, to perform deeds worthy of the White Book . [44]   – Jaime Lannister 's thoughts   Cersei : Ser Loras is so Tyrell he pisses rosewater. He should never have been given a white cloak .  Jaime : He would not have been my choice, I'll grant you. No one troubled to consult me. Loras will do well enough, I think. Once a man puts on that cloak, it changes him. [20]   – Cersei Lannister and Jaime Lannister    Cersei : Oh, how sad. Tommen will be heartbroken. He did so admire our gallant Knight of Flowers.  Aurane : The smallfolk too. We'll have maidens weeping into their wine all across the realm when Loras dies.
