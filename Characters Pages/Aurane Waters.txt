He has a cleft in his chin and has a beard. [6] His appearance reminds Cersei Lannister of Rhaegar Targaryen , although Aurane's face is narrower. [7]   Recent Events  A Clash of Kings  Aurane is a scion of House Velaryon and fights for Stannis Baratheon during the War of the Five Kings . After the Battle of the Blackwater , Aurane is captured and bends the knee to King Joffrey I Baratheon . [8]   A Feast for Crows  Aurane is pardoned for fighting for Stannis and wins the favor of Queen Regent Cersei Lannister , who believes that Aurane desires her. Cersei grants him the position of grand admiral , formerly the master of ships , on King Tommen I Baratheon 's small council . Since most of the royal fleet was destroyed at the Blackwater, Aurane receives funds to build a small fleet of dromonds . [6] Grand Maester Pycelle disagrees with Aurane's plan to captain the dromonds with younger men, rather than veterans of the Blackwater. [9]  Aurane tells Cersei that Ser Loras Tyrell was wounded during the siege of Dragonstone . [10] Cersei thinks Aurane covets Dragonstone , as the lordship he has been granted does not include a seat of his own, but she feels Rosby would be more fitting for him. [1] Because of increasing unrest in King's Landing after the arrest of Queen Margaery Tyrell , Aurane tells Queen Cersei that he will launch her new dromonds on the Blackwater Rush to keep the peace and potentially prevent Lord Mace Tyrell from rescuing his daughter, Margaery. During her imprisonment by the Faith of the Seven , Cersei is visited by Qyburn , who tells the queen that Lord Waters fled the capital with the new ships after her arrest. [11]   The Winds of Winter      Warning  This information has thus far been released in a sample chapter for The Winds of Winter , and might therefore not be in finalized form. Keep in mind that the content as described below is still subject to change.  According to Valena Toland , a new pirate king has set up on Torturer's Deep in the Stepstones , styling himself the Lord of the Waters . He commands three-decked warships. [2] Some readers have theorized this to be Aurane Waters, with the title Lord of the Waters being a play on "Waters", the surname for noble bastards from the crownlands such as Aurane himself, and the traditional title for the head of House Velaryon , " Lord of the Tides ".
