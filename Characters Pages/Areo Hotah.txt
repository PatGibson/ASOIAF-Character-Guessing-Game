 History 
 Areo was born in  Norvos [3]  as the youngest of six children. He was sold to the  bearded priests  at a young age. When he was sixteen years old, he completed his training. He was wedded to his axe and branded on his chest to signify the event. [2]  He became a guardsman to the family of Lady  Mellario , and was present the day she first met her future husband, Prince  Doran Martell . [3] [4]  He escorted Mellario when she traveled with Prince Doran to  Dorne , having learned  Westerosi  speech. Upon arrival in Dorne, Areo found it a strange place; the Dornish women were lewd, Dornish  wine  was sour, and Dornish food was full of queer hot spices. He also thought the Dornish sun was hotter than the pale, wan sun of Norvos. [5]  Areo entered the service of  House Martell , and Mellario married Doran. [2] 
 Areo watched all of Doran and Mellario's children grow up, and developed a father-like love for Princess  Arianne Martell , whom he refers to as "little princess." [2] [5]  Despite this affection, however, he is utterly loyal to Prince Doran. [2] [6]  Areo eventually became the captain of Prince Doran's guard, and remained in Dorne to serve the Martell's even after Mellario returned to Norvos. Even after all his years in Dorne, Areo still reminds himself of the vows he took when he was sixteen,  "Serve. Obey. Protect." [2] 
 When Doran Martell moved from  Sunspear  to the  Water Gardens  due to his deteriorating health, Areo accompanied him. On occasion, Areo is sent to Sunspear by Doran. [2]

 Areo is sent by Doran to put an end to  Arianne Martell 's plot to steal Princess  Myrcella Baratheon  away with the intention of crowning her Queen of the  Seven Kingdoms . During the confrontation, Ser  Arys Oakheart , Myrcella's  sworn shield , charges Areo and his guards and is slain by Areo. [6]  He then escorts Arianne back to Sunspear to await an audience with Doran. [4]  After she has spent several weeks in confinement, it is Areo who retrieves Arianne and brings her to Doran. [4] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Areo is present at the feast where Ser  Balon Swann  of the  Kingsguard  presents Prince  Doran Martell  with the  skull  of Ser  Gregor Clegane .

[5]  Areo is present when Prince Doran discusses his plans in a private  solar  with  Arianne Martell  and  Obara ,  Nymeria  and  Tyene Sand . [5] 
 
 Quotes by Areo
