[3] [4] He escorted Mellario when she traveled with Prince Doran to Dorne , having learned Westerosi speech. Upon arrival in Dorne, Areo found it a strange place; the Dornish women were lewd, Dornish wine was sour, and Dornish food was full of queer hot spices. He also thought the Dornish sun was hotter than the pale, wan sun of Norvos. [5] Areo entered the service of House Martell , and Mellario married Doran. [2]  Areo watched all of Doran and Mellario's children grow up, and developed a father-like love for Princess Arianne Martell , whom he refers to as "little princess." [2] [5] Despite this affection, however, he is utterly loyal to Prince Doran. [2] [6] Areo eventually became the captain of Prince Doran's guard, and remained in Dorne to serve the Martell's even after Mellario returned to Norvos. Even after all his years in Dorne, Areo still reminds himself of the vows he took when he was sixteen, "Serve. Obey. Protect."
