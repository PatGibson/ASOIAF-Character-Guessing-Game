 Appearance and Character 
 See also:  Images of Merrett Frey 
 Merrett is a big, broad man of middle height. In his youth, he was almost as robust as his older brother  Hosteen , the strongest son of Lord  Walder Frey , but in later years Merrett became "soft and fleshy." [2] 
 Ser  Jaime Lannister  remembers Merrett as slow, clumsy and stupid in his youth, with strength being his only positive quality. [3] 
 
 History 
 Merrett served with his mother  Amarei's  relative, Lord  Sumner Crakehall , as a page and later a squire. Like many  Crakehall  descendants, he was known for his strength and robustness. During this time, he knew  Jaime Lannister , also a squire at  Crakehall Castle , although the two were not close because of Merrett's habit of bullying others, which was not to Jaime's liking. Jaime is implied to have turned the tables on Merrett when the  Frey  boy tried to bully him. [3] 
 The downfall in Merrett's life began with the expedition against the  Kingswood Brotherhood . First he caught a pox from a camp follower, and later he was captured by  Wenda the White Fawn  and was branded on his arse with her mark, the fawn. He was freed after Lord Sumner paid a ransom, but was unable to sit for a fortnight and became the target of cruel jokes by the other squires. In his next fight, Merrett was hit with a mace that broke his helm, leaving him insensible for a fortnight. As a result, he suffered immense pain whenever he was hit in the head, and generally suffered extreme headaches for which he drank excessively to numb the pain. He was sent back to the  Twins  by Sumner and never knighted because of his injuries. His father, Lord  Walder Frey , began mocking him as Merrett Muttonhead. [2] [3] 
 Merrett married  Mariya Darry  around  282 AC , considered an excellent match at the time. However, soon after the wedding,  House Darry  lost most of their influence and power due to  Robert's Rebellion , in which they declared for  Aerys II Targaryen . Merrett fathered four daughters before the marriage produced a son,  Little Walder Frey . One daughter died when she was still a child and two other daughters shame their parents with promiscuity ( Gatehouse Ami ) and gluttony ( Fat Walda ), respectively. [2] 
 Consigned to a useless existence without  knighthood , troubled by persistent headaches, despised by his father and considering his wife a shrew and his children worthless, Merrett has gained the dubious distinction of being the biggest drunk in the Twins. [2] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Game of Thrones 
 Merrett is among the many  Freys  present at the  Twins  when  Catelyn Stark  comes to treat with Lord  Walder Frey  on behalf of  Robb Stark .
 
 A Clash of Kings 
 Merrett's daughter  Walda  marries Lord  Roose Bolton  at the  Twins . [4] [5] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
 While at  Harrenhal , Roose informs Ser  Jaime Lannister  that Lord Walder had offered the choice of a daughter or a granddaughter with her weight in silver as dowry; [6]  Roose chose "Fat Walda" because of her size. [7]  Merrett thinks this will gain him favor because of the importance of the alliance with  House Bolton , but is disappointed when Walder says he is not going to thank his son for fathering a daughter who made him pay a larger dowry than necessary because of her gluttony. [2] 
 During the planning of the  Red Wedding , Merrett is humiliated when  Lothar Frey  assigns him to get Lord  Greatjon Umber  too drunk to fight. Merrett passes out during the feast, but the Greatjon is sober enough to kill two men, break another's arm, and take part of Ser  Leslyn Haigh 's ear off before being subdued. [2] 
 After the Red Wedding, the  brotherhood without banners  of  Beric Dondarrion  kidnaps  Petyr Frey . Merrett volunteers to deliver the ransom for his great-nephew, hoping to gain favor within House Frey as he has no prospect of maintaining an existence on his own. Walder laughs at the suggestion of Merrett dealing with outlaws, but eventually gives his consent. [2] 
 Upon his arrival at  Oldstones , Merrett finds Petyr hanged for his involvement in the Red Wedding, and the brotherhood prepare to hang Merrett after taking the ransom. When the outlaws raise the death of  Robb Stark  at the Red Wedding, Merrett insists it was not murder, but justified vengeance for Robb insulting House Frey by marrying  Jeyne Westerling . He protests that all he did was drink and that the planning was done by Walder,  Ryman Frey  and Roose. The brotherhood reveals  Catelyn Stark , who had been slain by Merrett's brother  Raymund  and eventually tossed into the  Green Fork . Asked whether Merrett was part of the plot, the revived Catelyn just nods, as she cannot speak anymore. Merrett is then hanged by the brotherhood. [2] 
 
 A Feast for Crows 
 Hunting the murderers of Merrett and Petyr, Lord  Lucias Vypren  follows one band to  Fairmarket  but loses them there. Another group is pursued from  Hag's Mire  by hounds and hunters led by  Black Walder Frey , but their trace is lost when they reach the  Neck . Peasants who are questioned describe a  hooded woman  who is believed to be their leader, but nothing is heard of Beric or  Thoros of Myr . This creates doubts whether the brotherhood is responsible. [3] 
 While traveling to  Riverrun , Ser  Jaime Lannister  stops at  Castle Darry , the seat of his cousin, Lord  Lancel Lannister . He meets Merrett's widow,  Mariya Darry , and his eldest daughter,  Amerei , who is now Lancel's wife. Remembering Merrett to have been a bully, Jaime only praises Merrett as having been strong. When Amerei brings up her father's stories of fighting the  Kingswood Brotherhood , Jaime thinks of them as exaggerations and lies. Jaime raises a toast to Merrett, considering it easier to drink to the man than talk about him. Amerei later mentions that Ser  Harwyn Plumm  has promised her Beric's head and she tries to coax Jaime into finding the killers of her father as well, although without success. [3] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Merrett's son,  Little Walder Frey , serves as a squire to  Ramsay Bolton , [8]  who is the stepson of Merrett's daughter,  Walda . [9]  However, Walder is later found murdered at  Winterfell . [10]
