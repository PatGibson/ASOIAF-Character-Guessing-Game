[1] [2] He is regarded as a cruel, simple and small man.  History  According to a semi-canon source, [3] Amory threw the last Lord Tarbeck , a three-year-old boy, down a well during the Reyne-Tarbeck rebellion . Amory was responsible for the murder of the three-year old Princess Rhaenys Targaryen during the Sack of King's Landing . Alongside and in front of several House Lannister men-at-arms, [4] he dragged the screaming toddler from under her father Rhaegar's bed and stabbed her dozens of times. [5]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones  At the onset of the War of the Five Kings , Lord Tywin Lannister orders his brother, Ser Kevan , to direct Ser Amory, along with his fellow bannerman Ser Gregor Clegane and the sellsword Vargo Hoat , to forage the riverlands and to burn what he does not take. Each of the raider captains is to have three hundred cavalry. [6]   A Clash of Kings  Amory's raiding party encounters and attacks Yoren 's group of recruits for the Night's Watch (with Arya Stark hidden among them) and is responsible for Yoren's death at the town by the Gods Eye . [1] This attack is unprovoked as the Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the realm. Amory captures two innocent smallfolk, a beekeeper and his wife and threatens far and wide to hang them if Lord Beric Dondarrion does not surrender to him; when Beric surrenders, Amory hangs the beekeeper and his wife anyway with Beric strung up in the middle. Beric is later resurrected by Thoros of Myr . [7]  Amory is made castellan of Harrenhal by Tywin Lannister when Tywin takes the majority of his army east to engage Stannis Baratheon . [8] While castellan, Amory drinks a great deal of the best wine in the castle's cellars. [9] He is eventually captured by Lord Roose Bolton when Roose persuades Vargo Hoat to betray House Lannister and to seize control of the castle. After the fall of Harrenhal , Amory is paraded naked before Roose and Vargo. Pleading and sobbing, he is kicked into the bear pit to be killed by the bear inside it. Arya Stark is present to witness Amory's death and notes, "The bear is all in black. Like Yoren". [10]   A Storm of Swords  Tywin Lannister tells his son Tyrion Lannister of his plan to blame the deaths of Elia Martell and her children entirely on the deceased Amory, to circumvent giving Gregor Clegane over to Prince Oberyn Martell , who comes to King's Landing to seek justice for their deaths. [5]   A Feast for Crows  Ser Roger Hogg tells Jaime Lannister how Amory attacked his towerhouse at Sow's Horn even though he was sworn to House Hayford , who are sworn to King's Landing . [11]
