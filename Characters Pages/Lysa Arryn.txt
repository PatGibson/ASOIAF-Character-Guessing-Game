 Appearance and Character 
 See also:  Images of Lysa Tully 
 While she was a pretty, slender, high-breasted girl, dimpled and delicate, [6] [7]  in her youth, Lysa has grown thick of body by her early thirties, as a result of her many pregnancies, miscarriages and stillbirths. [3] [5] [6]  Despite being two years younger than her sister  Catelyn , Lysa looks ten years older; her face has become pale and puffy, and she now paints and powders it. [3] [6]  While Lysa uses scents to smell more sweet, she cannot completely hide the sour milky smell. [3]  She has the blue eyes of the Tullys, a small, petulant mouth and long, thick, auburn hair, which falls down to her waist. [6] [7] 
 According to a semi-canon source, Lysa wanted nothing more than to marry the man of her dreams as a young girl at  Riverrun . She idolized her older sister  Catelyn  for her betrothal to the heir of  Winterfell ,  Brandon Stark , and hoped to one day marry a man as noble and handsome as him. [8]  Her marriage to  Jon Arryn , however, was purely political, and while he was dutiful and kind to her, the marriage lacked the warmth Lysa required. [9] 
 While Lysa had been a soft, shy, [10]  delicate and timid girl in her youth, prone to tongue-tied silences and fits of giggles, [7]  her years at  King's Landing  were difficult for her, and changed her significantly, [6]  turning her into a woman who is by turns proud, fearful, cruel, dreamy, reckless, impulsive, timid, stubborn, vain, and inconstant. [10] [11]  She had never been brave in her youth, which did not change during adulthood. [12]   Grand Maester   Pycelle  considers Lysa to have never been "the strongest and most disciplined of minds", claiming that Lysa has seen enemies in every shadow since her last stillbirth. [13]  Lysa is fiercely protective of her young son,  Robert , and goes through great lengths to keep him by her side, [14] [15]  e.g. fleeing from court when the  Robert I Baratheon  offered for young Robert to be fostered by his father-in-law  Tywin Lannister , [16]  and threatening her own sister, Catelyn, with execution upon the suggestion that Robert could be fostered at  Winterfell  amongst his cousins. [14] 
 
 History

 Early life 
 Lysa was born as the second daughter of Lord  Hoster Tully , head of  House Tully  and Lord of  Riverrun , and his wife, Lady  Minisa Whent . She has one older sister,  Catelyn , and one younger brother,  Edmure . Her mother, who had given birth to two boys previously (who had both died in infancy), [17]  died giving birth to her sixth child, who died with her. [18] 
 Lysa was raised at Riverrun, alongside her two siblings and her father's young ward,  Petyr Baelish . [19]  As a young girl, Lysa would run and hide whenever she had done something wrong, so her father could not find her. [12]  Just as her siblings and her father's ward, Petyr, were wont to do, Lysa always went to her uncle, Ser  Brynden Tully , with her tears and tales, whenever Lord Hoster was too busy, and Lady Minisa too ill. [6]  Lysa and Catelyn played together, as girls, and even had a secret language. [11]  Once they made mud pies and served them to Petyr, who ate them and as a result was sick for a week. [20]  On one occasion, Lysa accompanied her father to  Seagard  with her sister, but on their way back to Riverrun, she and Catelyn got lost due to the mist. Petyr Baelish, who had accompanied Lord Hoster as well, eventually found them. [21] 
 Being raised alongside Petyr, Lysa fell in love with him, but her feelings were not reciprocated. Instead, Petyr fell in love with Lysa's older sister Catelyn. [15] [22]  When they were stilll young Lysa and Catelyn had first learnt to kiss by taking turns kissing Petyr, [23]  making Petyr the first man Lysa ever kissed. [3]  Catelyn recalls it as having been very innocent, though Petyr attempted to kiss them with tongue, which Lysa allowed. [23]  On the night Catelyn's betrothal to  Brandon Stark  was announced, [24]  Petyr, after having danced with Catelyn, tried to kiss her, and she rejected him, laughing. Petyr got drunk because of this, and after the boy had been brought to bed, Lysa followed and climbed into his bed to "give him comfort". Petyr took her virginity that night, telling her he loved her whilst he drunkenly believed that she was Catelyn, going as far as calling her "Cat" before he fell asleep. Despite this, Lysa stayed with him until sunrise, and would later come to remember the night fondly. [15]  When Catelyn's wedding date to Brandon Stark was eventually announced in  282 AC , Petyr challenged Brandon for Catelyn's hand. [24]  Brandon wounded Petyr severely and Lysa helped nurse him. In the following fortnight, they slept together again. Lysa became pregnant with Petyr's child as a result of this. [15]  After Hoster had send Petyr back to the Fingers, Lysa revealed her pregnancy to him, hoping that Hoster would relent and let her wed Petyr, but Hoster, who had always felt Petyr was too lowborn, [3]  instead forced her to abort the child with  moon tea , provided by Maester  Kym . [15] [24]  Lysa nearly dies from this. [25] 
 
 Marriage 
 Lord  Hoster Tully  and Lord  Tywin Lannister  had been discussing a betrothal between Lysa and  Jaime Lannister , the heir to  Casterly Rock . This potential betrothal was off the table when King  Aerys II Targaryen  named Jaime to his  Kingsguard  in  281 AC . [26] [27] [28]  Lord Tywin offered his younger son,  Tyrion , instead but was rebuffed by Lord Hoster, who stated that he wanted "a whole man" for Lysa. [28]  During  Robert's Rebellion , Lysa was married to Lord  Jon Arryn , Lord of the  Eyrie  and Defender of the Vale. [29]  Lord Arryn was already an old man and their marriage forged a useful wartime alliance with House Tully. In addition, Jon needed a wife known to be fertile, as his last heir had died during the  Battle of the Bells . [9]  She married Jon at Riverrun, in the same ceremony as her sister married Lord  Eddard Stark , [29]  But unlike Catelyn's marriage, Lysa's had been hastily arranged. [9]  While she had wept much at the morning of their wedding, Lysa had been dry-eyed and radiant during the ceremony itself. [30]  Both Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark played key roles in the successful rebellion, and after the dubble wedding soon left to continue fighting. Lysa and Catelyn both remained at Riverrun, and when their moon blood did not come at the accustomed time, both girls believed they were pregnant, with Lysa convinced they were both pregnant with a son. While for Catelyn this was indeed the case, Lysa's moon blood came not much later, and "all the joy" went out of her. After Catelyn gave birth to  Robb , she gave him to Lysa to hold, but, dissolving into tears, Lysa immediately gave the boy back to her sister. [9] 
 After the war ended, King  Robert I Baratheon  named Jon Arryn as his  Hand  on his coronation, [31] [32]  a position that took him away to  King's Landing  for long periods of time. Additionally, Lysa's uncle, Ser  Brynden Tully , who had been fighting with his older brother Hoster for years, took Lysa's marriage as an oppertunity to join the service of  House Arryn , chosing to serve Lysa and her new husband instead, and informed his brother of this fact during Lysa's wedding feast. [6] 
 Jon was already a fairly old man when Lysa married him, and he was proud. Due to Jon's position as Hand of the King, the pair lived in  King's Landing . Because of Lysa's soiled state and the age difference between them, theirs was a loveless marriage. [9]  In addition, Lysa had many troubles with childbirth. Including two boys and three girls, [3]  Lysa suffered two miscarriages in the  Eyrie  and three in  King's Landing , and gave birth to two stillborn children. [6] [9]  After suffering her last stillbirth, Lysa became paranoid, seeing enemies everywhere. [33]  She eventually gave birth to a son,  Robert , in  292 AC . [34]  However, Robert is a sickly child, suffering from the 'shaking sickness'. Being her only living child, Lysa became overprotective, and would still be breastfeeding him when he was six years old. [6] 
 Lysa and her sister Catelyn last saw each other in  293 AC . [6]  Lysa also met Catelyn's eldest daughter,  Sansa , [3]  though it is unknown whether these two events occured at the same time.
 Despite her marriage, Lysa did not forget Petyr Baelish. She convinced her new husband to give Petyr the customs for  Gulltown  around  289 AC , where Petyr performed so well that Arryn eventually brought him to court, eventually rising to the position of  master of coin . [3] [19]  During this time, Lysa and Petyr begin a secret affair. [25] 
 Near the start of  A Game of Thrones  Lysa's husband, Jon, had grown concerned about how weak his son was and arranged for the boy to be fostered with Lord  Stannis Baratheon  on  Dragonstone . [35] [36]  Lysa was furious upon learning about this arrangement, [36]  and as per Petyr's instructions, poisons Jon with the  Tears of Lys , [15]  making his death appear natural. [13]  After Jon's abrupt death, King Robert attempted to arrange for Lysa's son Robert to become a ward of Lord  Tywin Lannister  at  Casterly Rock , as he feared that being raised by his mother would make his namesake weak. However, Lysa refused the suggestion brusquely and, against the wishes of the king, fled with her son from King's Landing back to the  Vale of Arryn , without bidding farewell. [16]

 Catelyn takes  Tyrion Lannister  prisoner when she accidentally meets him during her journey back from  King's Landing  to  Winterfell .

[2] [10]  Catelyn tries to persuade her sister to mobilize an army and join with their father  Hoster Tully  and the  north  against the Lannisters, but Lysa refuses.

 A Clash of Kings 
 Despite her kin fighting the  Lannisters , Lysa keeps the  Vale of Arryn  neutral in the  War of the Five Kings .
 During his attempt to discover who on the  small council  is informing on him to  Cersei Lannister ,  Tyrion Lannister  tells  Petyr Baelish  that he wishes for Baelish to convince Lysa to agree to the betrothal between Princess  Myrcella Baratheon  and Lysa's son  Robert . [19]  In truth, however, the suggestion is a ruse, and Baelish never leaves King's Landing to propose the match to Lysa. [38]

[28]  Petyr brings  Sansa Stark  with him to the  Vale , disguised as his  natural daughter  "Alayne Stone", but he informs Lysa who she really is. Lysa and Petyr marry at the  Baelish ancestral seat . [3] 
 Sansa strongly resembles the deceased  Catelyn . [3]  One morning at the Eyrie, Lysa catches Petyr kissing Sansa. She blames Sansa and during a emotional row almost throws her from the  Eyrie 's  Moon Door . Sansa is saved by the timely intervention of Petyr, who stops Lysa from sending Sansa to her death. Lysa is hysterical about the idea that Petyr might desire Sansa, and confesses how she and Petyr had maintained a relationship during their time in  King's Landing , and she had convinced her husband, Jon, to appoint Petyr as manager of customs at  Gulltown  (which led to Petyr being brought to court and eventually to his appointment as  master of coin ) [19] . She also proclaims how she had poisoned her husband, as instructed by Petyr, and how she had sent her sister a letter accusing the  Lannisters  of the murder, again as per Petyr's instructions. [15] 
 Petyr calms Lysa down, but confesses to her that he has only ever loved Lysa's sister, Catelyn. He then throws Lysa from the mountain through the Moon Door, framing her personal singer  Marillion  for the deed. [15] 
 
 A Feast for Crows 
 Following Lysa's death, Petyr remains  Lord Protector of the Vale . He has Marillion confess to murdering Lysa in front of the  Lords Declarant , and convinces Sansa to place the blame on Marillion as well. [39] 
 
 Quotes 
 A man will tell you  poison  is dishonorable, but a woman’s honor is different.  The Mother  shaped us to protect our children, and our only dishonor is in failure. [3] 
 
 – Lysa to  Sansa Stark 
 
 
 You  can't want  her . You can't. She's a stupid empty-headed little girl. She doesn't love you the way I have. I've always loved you. I've proved it, haven't I? I gave you  my maiden's gift . I would have given you a son too, but they murdered him with  moon tea , with  tansy  and mint and wormwood, a spoon of honey and a drop of pennyroyal. It wasn't me, I never knew, I only drank what  Father  gave me... [15] 
 
 – Lysa to  Petyr Baelish 
 
 
 Tears, tears, tears. No need for tears... but that's not what you said in  King's Landing . You told me to put the  tears  in  Jon's  wine, and I did. For  Robert , and for us! And I wrote  Catelyn  and told her the  Lannisters  had killed my lord husband, just as you said. That was so clever... you were always clever, I told  Father  that, I said Petyr's so clever, he'll rise high, he will, he will, and he's sweet and gentle and I have his little baby in my belly... Why did you kiss her? Why? We're together now, we're together after so long, so very long, why would you want to kiss  herrrrrr ? [15] 
 
 – Lysa to  Petyr Baelish 
 
 Quotes about Lysa 
 I'd tell you to slap some sense into your sister, if I thought it would do any good, but you'd only bruise your hand. [6] 
 
 –  Brynden Tully , to  Catelyn Stark 
 
 
 Mead  and marriage had taken years off Lady Lysa. She laughed at everything so long as she held  her husband's  hand, and her eyes seemed to glow whenever she looked at him. [3]
