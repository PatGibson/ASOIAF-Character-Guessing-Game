[1] This is the fashion in the Free City of Volantis for slaves and servants. In his youth, he was a clever boy with astonishing wit; after his accident, however, his mind and body are broken. After his survival from the shipwreck he is described as soft and obese, subject to twitches and trembles and has a weird sideways walk. [2]   History   Patchface - by Amok ©  Patchface was a jester slave in Volantis . He was a clever boy with astonishing wit. His freedom was bought by Lord Steffon Baratheon , who was impressed with him and intended to bring him back to Storm's End from his trip to the Free Cities :  The king — the old king, Aerys II Targaryen, who had not been quite so mad in those days, had sent his lordship to seek a bride for Prince Rhaegar, who had no sisters to wed. “We have found the most splendid fool,” he wrote Cressen, a fortnight before he was to return home from his fruitless mission. “Only a boy, yet nimble as a monkey and witty as a dozen courtiers. He juggles and riddles and does magic, and he can sing prettily in four tongues. We have bought his freedom and hope to bring him home with us. Robert will be delighted with him, and perhaps in time he will even teach Stannis how to laugh. [2]   Maester  Cressen regrets that Patchface never did teach Stannis to laugh. Lord Steffon Baratheon 's ship, Windproud , broke up in Shipbreaker Bay within sight of Storm's End while his sons Stannis Baratheon and Robert Baratheon watched. Everyone aboard ship was killed including the lord, his lady, and over 100 soldiers and sailors. Patchface washed up three days later, his naked skin white, wrinkled, and, the man that found him, Jommy , swears to his dying day that the fool's skin was clammy cold. They had taken him for dead, but then he coughed up water, albeit broken in mind and body; the ordeal had taken his memories, and half his wit. Now he is subject to twitches and trembles and mostly incoherent. What happened to him during the two days is unknown, but the fisher folk like to say "a mermaid had taught him to breathe water in return for his seed." It was suggested by Ser Harbert , the castellan of Storm’s End, that it would be kindest for Maester Cressen to let the mad boy die, but he had refused, and he now wonders at that decision. Patchface is employed as court fool and jester at Dragonstone. He spends most of his time with Shireen Baratheon , Stannis's daughter, who calls him Patches. He offers her strange insights and stranger songs, sometimes touching upon what may have really happened to the boy at the bottom of the bay. [2]   Recent Events  A Clash of Kings  Patchface accompanies Princess Shireen Baratheon when she visits Maester  Cressen in his chamber to see the white raven . Later the fool is at the feast where Cressen attempts to kill Melisandre with poisoned wine, but the poison does not affect her. Cressen drinks what is left, and dies. [2]  Patchface is in attendance when Stannis Baratheon burns the statues of the Seven on Dragonstone 's beach. [3]  Petyr Baelish alleges that Shireen is the daughter of Patchface and Selyse Florent . [4]   A Storm of Swords  When Davos Seaworth returns to Dragonstone, he finds Patches playing with Shireen and Edric Storm . [5]   A Dance with Dragons  Patches accompanies Shireen and Selyse to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and Castle Black . [6] Melisandre tells Jon Snow that she has glimpsed the fool in her flames and considers him dangerous. [7]   Rhymes  Some of Patchface's rhymes seem to be of prophetic nature, though none of his listeners understand them; see Patchface/Theories .
