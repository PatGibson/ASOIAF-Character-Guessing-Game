 In  King's Landing , Bronn recruits a force of sellswords, eventually near eight hundred, [16]  to protect  Tyrion Lannister , alongside the  City Watch  and Tyrion's clansmen. [17]  A freshly-shaven Bronn becomes the captain of  Tyrion's guards , wearing the crimson cloak of the Lannisters and the black breastplate of the City Watch. [6]  Bronn scoffs at the  wight  hand brought to the capital by Ser  Alliser Thorne . [18]  Tyrion has Bronn find a thief, a poisoner, a mummer, and a murderer for his  plot to free Jaime Lannister  from captivity at  Riverrun .

 With  Stannis Baratheon 's host traveling north toward King's Landing, Tyrion orders Bronn to have the waterfront burned between the  Blackwater Rush  and the city walls. [16]  Queen  Cersei Lannister  has Ser  Osmund Kettleblack  named to the Kingsguard, but the man is actually one of Bronn's informants. [16] 
 During the  Battle of the Blackwater , Bronn is put in charge of having oxen pull Tyrion's massive chain tight across the Blackwater, which prevents  Stannis's ships  from escaping  wildfire . [23]  He receives  knighthood  after the battle, [24]  one of the six hundred men knighted by Osmund, Ser  Balon Swann , and Ser  Meryn Trant  of the Kingsguard. [25] [1] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
 While a wounded  Tyrion Lannister  recovers from his wounds, Bronn reveals that Lord  Tywin Lannister  put him forward for  knighthood . Ser Bronn of the Blackwater takes as his sigil a green, flaming chain on a smoking grey field, in commemoration of his role in the  Battle of the Blackwater . He wears soft leather boots, a wide with nuggets of silver, a wool doublet, and a pale green silk cloak. [1]  Tywin, the  Hand of the King , brings his own guards to  King's Landing , and Ser  Kevan Lannister  dismisses the sellswords hired by Bronn for Tyrion. [1] 
 Rather than the cheaper brothels he would previously have patronized, Ser Bronn is now able to visit  Chataya's brothel  on his own, sleeping with  Alayaya  and  Marei . [26]  He investigates the late Ser  Mandon Moore , who attempted to kill Tyrion at the Blackwater, [27]  and he attends the wedding of Tyrion and  Sansa Stark .

 Tyrion is arrested after the death of his nephew, King  Joffrey I Baratheon , at his  wedding feast . [31]  Cersei deprives her hated brother of an ally by arranging for Ser Bronn to wed  Lollys Stokeworth , as Lady  Tanda Stokeworth  is desperate for someone to wed her daughter. Bronn refuses to champion Tyrion a second time in a  trial by combat , as it would mean facing the monstrous Ser  Gregor Clegane . [7]  Oberyn volunteers to champion Tyrion, but he is slain by the Mountain in single combat. [32] 
 At the  Fingers , Lord  Petyr Baelish  reveals to Sansa that the  Kettleblack  brothers are actually in his employ, not Bronn's. [33]

 Lady  Tanda Stokeworth  informs Queen Regent  Cersei Lannister  that Bronn has given the name of  Tyrion Tanner  to the bastard son of his new wife,  Lollys Stokeworth , in dubious honor of his former employer,  Tyrion Lannister . [34] 
 The elderly Tanda shatters her hip while riding. [35]  Bronn takes four knights into his household at  Stokeworth , although Lollys's elder sister,  Falyse Stokeworth , and her husband, Ser  Balman Byrch , tell Cersei that they are upjumped  sellswords . Cersei fears that Bronn is still in league with Tyrion, who vanished after the murder of Lord  Tywin Lannister . Cersei suggests that Falyse and Balman have Bronn die in a hunting mishap. [35] 
 The chivalrous Balman instead challenges Bronn to single combat, planning to unhorse Bronn with his lance and then kill the stunned man on the ground. Bronn drives his lance through Balman's horse, however, which upends Balman and leaves him with crushed legs. When Balman asks for mercy, Bronn stabs him in the eye with his dagger and orders Falyse to leave Stokeworth. Claiming to be Lord Stokeworth, Bronn gives Falyse's clothes to Lollys. [2]  To prevent the queen's involvement from becoming known, Cersei sends Falyse to Qyburn, [2]  and the widow dies during his experiments. [36] [37] 
 Tanda dies from a chill, with Lollys succeeding her as Lady Stokeworth and Bronn as her lord. [36] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons

 Quotes by Bronn 
   Ser Bronn - by Pojypojy © 
 Tyrion : Scum you may be, but you're undeniably useful, and with a sword in your hand you're almost as good as my brother  Jaime . What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Land? Women? Keep me alive, and you'll have it. Bronn : And if you die? Tyrion : Why then, I'll have one mourner whose grief is sincere. The gold ends when I do. [10] — Tyrion Lannister  and Bronn 
 
 
 
 Tyrion : How do you know which ones to hire? Bronn : I look them over. I question them, to learn where they've fought and how well they lie. And then I give them a chance to kill me, while I do the same for them. Tyrion : Have you killed any? Bronn : No one we could have used. [17] — Tyrion Lannister  and Bronn 
 
 
 
 Tyrion : Tell me, Bronn. If I told you to kill a babe ...  an infant girl , say, still at her mother's breast ... would you do it? Without question? Bronn : Without question? No. I'd ask how much. [17] — Tyrion Lannister  and Bronn 
 
 
 
 By  your lord father's  command, I'm Ser Bronn of the Blackwater now, Imp. See you don't forget it. [1] —Bronn to  Tyrion Lannister 
 
 
 
  I like you well enough, ugly little whoreson that you are ... but if I fight your battle, I lose either way. Either  the Mountain  spills my guts, or I kill him and lose  Stokeworth . I sell my sword, I don't give it away. I'm not  your bloody brother . [7] —Bronn to  Tyrion Lannister 
 
 Quotes about Bronn 
 Courage he had, and strength, but there was no kindness in him, and little loyalty. [13] —thoughts of  Catelyn Stark 
 
 
 
 She had seen Bronn fight on the  high road ; it was no accident that he had survived the journey while other men had died. He moved like a panther, and that ugly sword of his seemed a part of his arm. [4] —thoughts of  Catelyn Stark 
 
 
 
 And this is Bronn, a  sellsword  of no particular allegiance. He has already changed sides twice in the short time I've known him, you and he ought to get on famously, Father. [39] — Tyrion Lannister  to  Tywin Lannister 
 
 
 
 Every lord has need of a beast from time to time ... a lesson you seem to have learned, judging from Ser Bronn and those  clansmen  of yours. [1] — Tywin Lannister  to  Tyrion Lannister 
 
 
 
 Is it your fault that Bronn’s an insolent black-hearted rogue? He’s always been an insolent black-hearted rogue. That's what I liked about him. [7] — Tyrion Lannister  to  Podrick Payne 
 
 
 
 Bronn was no  knight , that was true. Bronn was a battle-hardened killer. [40] —thoughts of  Cersei Lannister 
 
 
 
 Tyrion : You will find,  Lord Plumm , that I can be very generous to my friends. If you doubt me, ask Bronn. Ask  Shagga , son of  Dolf . Ask  Timett , son of  Timett . Tybero : And who would they be? Tyrion : Good men who pledged me their swords and prospered greatly by that service. Oh, very well, I lied about the 'good' part. They're bloodthirsty bastards, like  you lot . [38] — Tyrion Lannister  and  Tybero Istarion
