At six-and-ten he called himself a man, but in truth he had been a ribald drunk, who would sing, dance, play pipes, juggle and ride horses. He drank much, and claimed no man could piss longer or farther than him. He once wagered his ship against a flock of goats that he could douse a hearth-fire by urinating on it, and subsequently outraged his brother, Lord Balon , by naming the ship Golden Storm .
