 Benjen has sharp features and blue eyes, in which a hint of laughter is often present. He has long legs and is very thin. [1] 
 Benjen dresses in black, as befits a man from the  Night's Watch . When visiting Winterfell, he also wears a silver buckle and a heavy silver chain. [1] 
 
 History 
 Benjen was the youngest child of Lord  Rickard Stark  and Lady  Lyarra Stark . [7] [8]  He attended the  tourney at Harrenhal  with his siblings,  Brandon ,  Eddard , and  Lyanna , in  281 AC . At the tournament Lyanna rescued their father's vassal,  Howland Reed , from an attack by three squires. Benjen offered Howland a horse and some armor so he could challenge his attackers. During the feast held to celebrate the start of the tournament, he teased Lyanna when she cried for a sad and beautiful song by the noted musician, Prince  Rhaegar Targaryen . Lyanna poured wine over his head for tesing him. [3]  When a black brother from the  Night's Watch  spoke up during the feast, attempting to convince the gathered people to join the black brothers, [3]  Benjen took the plea to heart. [5] 
 The first time Benjen got well and truly drunk, he was younger than fourteen. [1] 
 Benjen was the Stark in  Winterfell  during  Robert's Rebellion . Although House Stark had been reduced to Benjen, Eddard, Eddard's infant son  Robb , and Eddard's infant  bastard  son  Jon Snow  due to the events of the war, Benjen joined the  Night's Watch  within a few months of Eddard's return north. His reasons for doing so are unknown. [9]  Benjen took his vows in front of a  heart tree  located half a league from  Castle Black , north of the  Wall . [10]  Benjen's skills served him well as a  ranger , [11]  and he quickly rose to the position of  First Ranger . [2] [5]   Mance Rayder  came to consider Benjen the bane of the  free folk . [12] 
 Benjen visited Winterfell on several occasions over the years. [13] [14]  Once,  Bran Stark  recited all of the names of the castles build at the  Wall  for Benjen. [13]  Benjen and Eddard had discussed repopulating the  Gift  by raising new lords, so they could function as a shield against the  wildlings . Benjen was convinced that  Lord Commander   Jeor Mormont  could be convinced to part with the land, on the condition that taxes would be paid to  Castle Black  instead of  Winterfell . [15] [16]  Benjen also wrote Eddard, keeping him updated on e.g., the  military strength  of the  Night's Watch . [17]  Benjen shares his brother Eddard's dislike for  Lannisters . [18] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Game of Thrones 
 When King  Robert I Baratheon  rides for  Winterfell , Lord  Eddard Stark  sends word to Benjen on the Wall. [17]  Benjen arrives in time for the feast held to welcome Robert to the north, where he speaks with Eddard's bastard son,  Jon Snow . Jon rashly asks to be allowed to join the Night's Watch, which results in an argument between him and Benjen after Benjen states that Jon is rather young, and the boy angrily refuses Benjens suggestion that he father some bastard sons of himself before committing to a life at the Wall. [1]  Nonetheless, Benjen approaches  maester   Luwin  about Jon, informing the maester of Jon's question. This leads to Luwin informing Eddard, and eventually Eddard sending Jon north to join the Night's Watch. [19] 
 When back at the  Wall  Benjen is busy with his duties as  First Ranger  and does not have much time for Jon. He reminds Jon that the men of the Night's Watch leave their families and loyalties behind when they join the brotherhood. [2] 
 Jeor Mormont ,  Lord Commander of the Night's Watch , sends Benjen with six rangers [2]  to find Ser  Waymar Royce , who has not returned after a ranging. [2] [20] [21]  Benjen thinks they might have to search as far as the  Shadow Tower . [2]  When there is no word from Benjen, Ser  Jaremy Rykker  leads two sweeps in search of him, while  Qhorin Halfhand  leads another search party going north from the  Shadow Tower . Nothing is found except a few blazes in trees that Benjen used to mark his way. The marks stop in the stony highlands to the northwest and all trace of Benjen vanishes. [22]  Jaremy takes over command of the rangers in Benjen's absence. [10] 
 The bodies of the rangers  Othor  and  Jafer Flowers , who had accompanied Benjen on his ranging, are later found. There is no trace of Benjen or any of the others, however. [6]  The two corpses rise as  wights  and attempt to kill Lord Commander Mormont. [6]  Jeor plans to find Benjen, either dead or alive, and makes it one of the goals of his  great ranging . [23] 
 
 A Clash of Kings 
 When arriving at  Craster's Keep , Lord Commander Jeor Mormont asks  Craster  whether he had seen Benjen recently, as Benjen was supposed to have passed the keep during his ranging the previous year. Craster claims not to have seen Benjen in three years. [21] 
 Jeor believes that Benjen cannot fail to notice the trail two hundred men from the Night's Watch and their horses leave behind during their great ranging, and is convinced that, if Benjen is still alive, he will be able to find his brothers at the  Fist of the First Men . [24] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Bran Stark  witnesses a vision from the past in which he sees a boy and a girl playing with wooden branches in the  godswood  of  Winterfell . [25]  Some readers believe this to have been Benjen and his older sister,  Lyanna , as Bran describes the girl as being the eldest of the two, and states that she looks like his sister  Arya , [26]  who is said to look like Lyanna had. [27]  Additionally, the girl refers to  Old Nan , [25]  placing the event Bran witnesses as having taken place in more recent generations.
