 Appearance and Character 
 See also:  Images of Lyanna Stark 
 Lyanna is described by most people as beautiful. [3] [4]  Though  maester   Yandel  describes her as "a wild and boyish young thing with none of the Princess  Elia's  delicate beauty", [5]   Kevan Lannister  recalls Lyanna having a "wild beauty" about her. [6]  According to her brother Eddard, Lyanna had been a child-woman of surpasing loveliness. [3]  She was slim of frame. [7]   Arya Stark , with her brown hair, long face and grey eyes, [8] [9]  resembles Lyanna in appearance, according to Eddard Stark. [4]   Margaery Tyrell , also brown of hair, [10]  is believed by some to resemble Lyanna, though Eddard disagrees. [10] 
 According to Eddard Lyanna had a touch of wildness to her, which was described as "the wolf blood" by her father,  Rickard Stark . Eddard compares her to his tomboyish daughter  Arya  in personality, adding that Lyanna probably would have carried a sword if their father had allowed it. [4]  Lyanna was strong of will. [11] 
While  Robert Baratheon , who had been deeply infatuated with Lyanna and remains very much in love with her memory over fifteen years after her death to the point of causing major strain in his marriage to  Cersei Lannister , [3] [12]  believes Lyanna would never have publicly opposed him the way Cersei does. However, according to Eddard, Robert never really knew Lyanna. He says that Robert saw only Lyanna's beauty, and never "the iron underneath". [13]  Lyanna may have been considerably less enthusiastic about the marriage than Robert was, as she commented to Ned that Robert's love for her would not prevent him from being unfaithful after their marriage. [14] 
 Lyanna is noted to have been a skilled rider who loved to ride. [15] [16]  According to  Harwin  of  Winterfell , Lyanna rode "like a northman", [15]  while  Barbrey Dustin  describes her as a centaur, [16]  and  Roose Bolton  states that Lyanna was "half a horse herself". [17] 
 Lyanna had been fond of flowers, [3]  and loved the scent of winter roses. [18] 
 
 History 
   Lyanna, her brother, and  Rhaegar  by M.Luisa Giliberti © 
   Lyanna, wearing a crown of  blue winter roses  – by Enife © 
 Early life 
 Born at  Winterfell , [2]  Lyanna was the only daughter of Lord  Rickard Stark  and Lady  Lyarra Stark . She had two older brothers,  Brandon  and  Eddard , and one younger brother,  Benjen . [19] [20] 
 Lyanna's brother Eddard was fostered at the  Eyrie  by Lord  Jon Arryn  since the age of eight, where he befriended his fellow ward  Robert Baratheon . [21]  Eddard brought Robert's suit to Winterfell, [2]  and Rickard agreed to betroth his daughter to the young Lord of  Storm's End . [14]  However, that night Lyanna confided to Eddard that she believed Robert would never be able to keep to one bed. She had heard that Robert had  an illegitimate daughter  in the  Vale , which Eddard could not deny. He attempted to persuade her that what Robert had done before their betrothal was insignificant and that he would love her, but Lyanna informed him that love could not change a man's nature. [14] 
 
 The Year of the False Spring 
 Lyanna was present at the  tourney at Harrenhal  in  281 AC . She happened upon  Howland Reed , who was being bullied by three young squires, none older than fifteen. She roared "That's my father's man you're kicking" and attacked them with a tourney sword. The bullies scattered and Lyanna took Howland back to her tent, where she cleaned his wounds and bound them with linen. Then she introduced him to her brothers  Brandon ,  Eddard , and  Benjen . That evening, a feast was held to celebrate the start of the tourney. Lyanna persuaded Howland to attend the feast, as he was highborn and had as much right to attend as anyone. During the feast Prince  Rhaegar Targaryen , a noted musician, performed a sad and beautiful song that made Lyanna weep. However, when Benjen teased her for crying, she poured wine over his head. [11]  During the feast, Lyanna recognized the three squires who had bullied Howland and pointed them out to her brothers. [11]  A  mystery knight  known as the  Knight of the Laughing Tree  defeated the knights the three bullies served, and demanded them to be chastised as ransom payment. [11]  Some fans  have suggested Lyanna for the identity  of the mystery knight.
 Prince Rhaegar won the tournament, but instead of crowning his own wife, Princess  Elia Martell , as the  queen of love and beauty , Rhaegar shocked those present by presenting the laurel of  blue winter roses  to Lyanna, placing it in her lap with the tip of his lance. [18] [5] 
At that moment "all the smiles died". [18]  Brandon Stark believed Rhaegar's action to have been a slight upon Lyanna's honor. Some people say that Robert, Lyanna's betrothed, laughed at Rhaegar's action, claiming that Rhaegar had only paid Lyanna her due; however, those closer to Robert claim that Robert brooded over the insult, and grew resentful of Rhaegar hence forth. [5] 
 
 Robert's Rebellion 
   Lyanna by eliafernandez© 
 The next year, Lyanna came face to face with Rhaegar ten leagues from  Harrenhal , [5]  and was taken by him with the help of Ser  Arthur Dayne  and Ser  Oswell Whent . [22]  When her brother Brandon, on his way to  Riverrun  for his wedding, learned about Lyanna's disappearance, he changed course towards  King's Landing , accompanied by several companions ( Ethan Glover ,  Jeffory Mallister ,  Kyle Royce  and  Elbert Arryn ). At the  Red Keep , he roared for Rhaegar "to come out and die". Though Rhaegar was not present, King  Aerys II  had Brandon and his companions arrested and charged them with treason, accusing them of plotting the murder of the crown prince. Aerys summoned their fathers to court, supposedly to answer the charge against their sons. Lord  Rickard Stark  demanded a  trial by combat , and though the king granted him the request, he chose "fire" as his champion. Lord Rickard was suspended from rafters over a blazing fire whilst dressed in his armor, while Brandon, attached to a device which tightened a cord around his neck whenever he moved, was forced to watch as his father was slowly cooked inside his armor. Brandon strangled himself in an attempt to reach a longsword. When King Aerys next demanded the heads of  Robert Baratheon  and  Eddard Stark , Lord  Jon Arryn  responded by raising his banners in revolt, starting  Robert's Rebellion . [23] [24] [25] 
 Opinions on Rhaegar's motivation in taking Lyanna differ. According to Robert Baratheon, Rhaegar raped Lyanna "hundreds of times". [3]  This is repeated by Eddard's young son  Bran Stark . [26]  However,  Barristan Selmy  is convinced that "Prince Rhaegar loved his Lady Lyanna". [27]   Daenerys Targaryen  believes that Rhaegar had stolen Lyanna away from her betrothed, [28]  and when she is about to marry, she thinks to herself that if  her paramour  loved her, he would "come and carry you off at swordpoint, as Rhaegar carried off his northern girl". [29]  According to  Viserys Targaryen , Rhaegar had fought and died for "the woman he loved", [30]  something which his sister Daenerys also believes. [31]  Additionally, one of the visions Daenerys sees in the  House of the Undying  depicts Rhaegar's death, where he whispers Lyanna's name with his last breath. [32] [22]  However, Viserys also believes that Rhaegar had simply not been happy with his marriage to Elia, which had led to him taking Lyanna. [28]   Cersei Lannister , who was infatuated with Rhaegar, has similar believes, as she is convinced that Rhaegar would never have looked twice at the "wolf girl" if he had been satisfied in his wife. [33]  Cersei's uncle  Kevan Lannister  believes that, if Aerys had accepted the proposal from  Tywin Lannister  to marry Cersei to Rhaegar, the war might have been avoided, as Cersei had been much more beautiful than Lyanna, and would have been able to give Rhaegar the sons he had wanted, [34]  something which Princess  Elia Martell  could not. [35] 
 
   Lyanna Stark by Dreambieng © 
 The war, led by Lyanna's fiancé Robert, her brother Eddard, and their foster father  Jon Arryn , lasted "close to a year". [36]  Lyanna's exact whereabouts during this time are unknown. Rhaegar himself could not be found, either, for a large part of the war, [22]  though he finally returned "from the south" [37]  after King Aerys II had dispatched Ser  Gerold Hightower , Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, to find him. [22]  Robert and Eddard faced Prince  Rhaegar  and the royal army at  the Trident , where Robert slew Rhaegar in single combat and the rebels defeated the royal army. [3]  A fortnight later, the  Sack of King's Landing  officially ended the war, [38]  though Lyanna still remained missing and the last opposition still had to be dealt with. From King's Landing, Eddard Stark rode south to the  Stormlands  to lift the  siege of Storm's End . From there he rode to the a place Rhaegar was said to have named the  Tower of Joy , located in the  Red Mountains  of  Dorne . [39] 
 
 Death 
   ‎Promise me  Ned  - by Asiulus © 
 Eddard brought only six companions with him:  Martyn Cassel ,  Theo Wull ,  Ethan Glover ,  Mark Ryswell ,  Howland Reed  and  Willam Dustin . At the tower of joy, they found the three remaining loyalist members of Aerys II Targaryen's  Kingsguard , Ser  Arthur Dayne , Ser  Oswell Whent , and Ser  Gerold Hightower . The men  met in battle , and only Eddard and Howland Reed survived. [39]  Inside the tower, Eddard found Lyanna in a "bed of blood", dying. [39] [2]  Lyanna died in a room that smelled of "blood and roses". [3]  A fever had taken her strength, and her voice had been faint as a whisper. There was fear in her eyes, while she called for "Ned" to promise her something. When her brother gave his word, the fear left her. She smiled, and her fingers clutched his own in a tight grip. [3]  Lyanna died shortly thereafter. [14]  Eddard was still holding her as she "gave up her hold on life" and rose petals slipped from her palm, dead and black. Later,  Howland Reed  found Eddard still holding the corpse. Howland managed to separate the hands of the living man and the dead girl, though Eddard had no recollection of what happened after Lyanna died. [3] 
 It is currently unknown what promise Lyanna extracted from Eddard, and what had caused her fear. Lyanna's last words, "Promise me, Ned", would haunt Eddard, who had to pay a price in order to keep his promises to her, [14]  for the rest of his life. [40] [18]  When his daughter  Sansa  pleads for the life of her direwolf,  Lady , it reminds him of Lyanna's pleading. [41]

 At the time of her death, Lyanna had only been sixteen years old. [3]  Though Eddard burried the bodies of his deceased companions and the three slain Kingsguard knights in cairns he created out of the stones from the tower, [39]  he transported Lyanna's bones from  Dorne  back to  Winterfell . [16]  According to him, Lyanna had wanted to be burried beside her father and brother. [3]  Her tomb lies in the  crypts of Winterfell , beside that of Rickard and Brandon Stark. [26]  A statue of Lyanna has been carved in the stone of her tomb, though Robert Baratheon feels the stonemason failed to capture her beauty. [3]  While only the  kings  and lords of Winterfell are supposed to have statues in their likeness, not their family members, both Lyanna and Brandon were given a statue by Eddard because he wished to honor his beloved siblings. [26]  Eddard brought flowers to Lyanna's tomb whenever possible, as she had been fond of flowers. [3] 
 
 Legacy 
 King  Robert I Baratheon , Lyanna's betrothed, and Eddard, her brother, had had a falling out after Robert was accepting of the manner at which Rhaegar's wife and two young children had been slain during the Sack of King's Landing. [36]  Lyanna's death and the grief they shared over her passing eventually reconcilled them. Though Robert had no desire to marry after Lyanna's death, he was eventualy convinced by Jon Arryn that the realm needed an heir. As such, Robert was married to  Cersei Lannister . [13]  However, during their wedding night, a drunken Robert called Cersei "Lyanna", [42]  which began the strains in their marriage. Robert remained in love with Lyanna, [12]  and named the war galley  Lady Lyanna  in her honor. [43] 
 At  Bear Island , Lady  Maege Mormont  named her youngest daughter  Lyanna , after Lyanna Stark, which according to  Stannis Baratheon  was an attempt to win the favor of Lord Eddard Stark. [44] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Game of Thrones 
 Under the influence of  milk of the poppy ,  Eddard Stark  dreams about the  combat at the tower of joy . While Eddard and his six companions battle the three  Kingsguard  knights in front of the tower, Lyanna is screaming inside the tower. [39] 
 Eddard Stark has a nightmare involving Lyanna and the statue of her placed at her tomb. In the dream, Eddard walks through the crypts of Winterfell. He can hear the statue of Lyanna whispering: "Promise me, Ned". He notices the statue wearing a garland of pale blue roses, while her eyes weep blood. Eddard immediately wakes with his heart racing. [40] 
 
 A Clash of Kings 
 Theon Greyjoy  has a nightmare involving a feast of the dead at Winterfell. Many of the dead men and women attending are people that Theon knew personally or were slain by his own hand or command. But he also notices faces that he had never known in life. Among them is Lyanna: a slim, sad girl wearing a crown of pale blue roses and a white gown splattered with blood. Brandon Stark stands beside her, their father Rickard just behind them. [7] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Bran Stark  witnesses a vision from the past in which he sees a boy and a girl playing with wooden branches in the  godswood  of  Winterfell . [45]  Several fans believe this to have been Benjen and his older sister, Lyanna, as Bran describes the girl as being the eldest of the two, and states that she looks like his sister  Arya , [29]  who is said to look like Lyanna had. [4]  Additionally, the girl refers to  Old Nan , [45]  placing the event Bran witnesses as having taken place in more recent generations.
