[1] [2] He is nearly sixty years old, with a massive belly and fingers the size of sausages. [8]  Wyman is amiable and has a loud, booming laugh. He is mocked by his own people as Lord Lamprey. [1] By his own admission, and because of his physical appearance, Wyman is seen by many as craven and foolish, however, this is a clever front; he is shrewd, calculating and intelligent. He is also staunchly loyal to House Stark . [9] A prodigious eater, Wyman enjoys boiled eggs, [4] capons, [1] eels, [8] lampreys, [10]  pork pies , [11] porridge, [12] and sausages. [4]  Wyman wears rich clothing, including a velvet blue-green doublet embroidered with golden thread. A golden trident pins his mantle to his shoulder.

He sends his two sons, Ser Wylis and Ser Wendel , in his absence. [8]   A Clash of Kings   Wyman Manderly by The Mico  Wyman comes to Winterfell to partake in the harvest feast , bringing a retinue of knights , retainers, and entertainers, [1] as well as twenty casks of seafood. [10] To Bran Stark , Ser Rodrik Cassel , and Maester Luwin , Lord Manderly proposes to mint new coinage for Robb, the new King in the North , and a new war fleet for the north . He also offers himself or Wendel as a possible new husband for the widowed Lady Donella Hornwood . [1] Despite his size, Wyman dances gracefully with Beth Cassel during the feast. [10]  When Ramsay Snow , the Bastard of Bolton, kidnaps and forcibly marries Lady Hornwood, Wyman moves quickly to seize Hornwood and prevent House Bolton from having it. [14]  In response to Theon Greyjoy 's capture of Winterfell , Wyman sends a dozen barges packed with knights, warhorses, and siege engines up the White Knife to join Rodrik's army. [15] However, these Stark loyalists are betrayed by Ramsay and the garrison of the Dreadfort in the battle at Winterfell . [16]   A Storm of Swords  While traveling in the wolfswood , the crippled Bran recalls that during the harvest feast Lord Wyman looked at him with less pity than other northern lords. However, Bran does not know if White Harbor is safe from the Boltons, and he decides instead to journey beyond the Wall to find the three-eyed crow .

[20] It is later reported to Cersei that Wyman has had Davos executed. Members of House Frey testify that they have seen his head, confirming Wyman's claim. [21] In return, Cersei orders her brother, Ser Jaime Lannister , to release Wylis from captivity at Harrenhal . [22]   A Dance with Dragons  Stannis Baratheon sends a letter from Castle Black to White Harbor demanding fealty to him as king. Wyman responds with obfuscation, speaking of his age and infirmity. Jon Snow informs Stannis that Val would refuse to marry Wyman. [2]  Robett Glover comes to White Harbor to try raising men, but it is believed that Lord Manderly is refusing his pleas. Supported by the Iron Throne , Rhaegar , Symond , and Jared arrive in White Harbor on Lionstar as envoys and to return the bones of Ser Wendel Manderly . [23] In return for the freedom of his surviving son, Ser Wylis Manderly , for whom he has to pay a ransom of three thousand dragons , and peace with the Iron Throne , Wyman agrees to marry a daughter of Lord Walder Frey and to marry his granddaughters Wynafryd and Wylla to Rhaegar and Little Walder Frey , respectively. Wyman also agrees to relinquish his claim to Hornwood . [7]  Lord Davos Seaworth arrives to treat with Wyman on behalf of Stannis and is brought before the Merman's Court . A large audience is present, with the three Freys and Wylis's family in attendance. A pallid Wyman listens to Jared claim that Wendel sacrificed his life to save Lord Walder Frey from Robb Stark , who had turned into a wolf . When Rhaegar insults Robb, claiming he was a vile dog who died like one, and that Tommen I Baratheon is the rightful king, Wyman agrees with him. Wylla speaks in favor of Davos, saying they should join Stannis for vengeance and that she will not marry a Frey, but Lord Wyman threatens to send her to the silent sisters . After Wyman hears Davos's plea to join Stannis's cause, he orders his cousin, Ser Marlon Manderly , to have Davos executed. [7]  Instead of executing Davos, Wyman sends Davos to comfortable captivity in the Wolf's Den , a prison in White Harbor, and a criminal who resembles Davos is killed instead. The unnamed man's head and hands are removed and dipped in tar, and his fingers are shortened by Ser Bartimus so that the publicly-displayed remains look like Davos's. Once the Freys inform Cersei's small council that Lord Manderly ordered the execution of the Onion Lord, the Iron Throne returns Wylis from captivity at Maidenpool . [9]  During the celebration feast welcoming Wylis home to White Harbor, Wyman meets secretly in the New Castle with Davos and Robett. He apologizes for the way in which Davos has been treated, tells him he agrees with Wylla about the debt White Harbor owes the Starks , and explains he is acting cowardly to deceive the Lannisters and Freys. Wyman has been building warships at White Harbor and hiding them up the White Knife. [9] He claims there are spies around him, not trusting Maester Theomore , who was born a Lannister of Lannisport .

Wyman promises Davos he will swear allegiance to Stannis if Rickon Stark is retrieved from Skagos . [9]    Wyman with his three pies , by Jake Murray © Fantasy Flight Games  Wyman leaves White Harbor to attend the wedding of Ramsay to " Arya Stark " with an armed escort. Before doing so, he gives his three Frey guests a palfrey each; guest gifts are given to guests when they leave their host's protection, meaning they are no longer under the protection of guest right . [3] The Frey envoys disappear while en route to Barrowton . [3] Wyman claims the Freys rode ahead of him, being that he cannot ride a horse and instead travels slowly by barge and litter.

[3]  Big Walder Frey thinks the envoys were killed by Wyman. [3]  Lord Roose Bolton , the new Warden of the North , moves his son Ramsay's wedding from Barrowton to Winterfell . [3] Wyman brings a huge supply of food but no hostages, which unsettles Roose. [3] Wyman provides food and drink for the wedding feast, during which the jolly lord calls for Abel to sing " The Night That Ended " and about Danny Flint . He serves three huge pies himself, the first portions to Roose and Walda Bolton and the next to Hosteen and Aenys, and Lord Manderly eats two slice from each pie himself. [11] Roose does not eat or drink anything unless he sees Wyman taste it first. While being helped from the hall, a drunken Wyman tells Abel to sing of the Rat Cook . [11]  Among the snowmen that squires build along the battlements of Winterfell, one resembling Wyman is the fattest snowman Theon Greyjoy has ever seen. Lady Barbrey Dustin does not believe that Roose would allow Lord Manderly to survive the upcoming battle with Stannis. [12]  When tensions arise from the blizzard, Aenys and Hosteen accuse Lord Manderly of being responsible for the disappearance of their kin, but Wyman pleads ignorance. [24] Aenys suspects the Manderlys are to blame after several men-at-arms in the castle are murdered, but Barbrey and Ser Roger Ryswell are skeptical. [24] When Little Walder Frey is murdered, Hosteen accuses Wyman, who denies the charge yet at the same time insults House Frey, which causes an enraged Hosteen to attack Wyman.

Stannis is angered at Wyman's support of the Boltons , but Theon does not believe Wyman would coordinate with the Freys against Stannis. [25]   Quotes by Wyman  If I had thought to see war again in my lifetime, I should have eaten a few less eels. [8] —Wyman, to Catelyn Stark     Why, no prince is ever late. "Those who arrive before him have come early, that's all. [1] —Wyman, to Bran Stark     King Robb has no more loyal servant than Wyman Manderly. [1] —Wyman, to Rodrik Cassel     When treating with liars, even an honest man must lie. [9] —Wyman, to Davos Seaworth     I am fat, and many think that makes me weak and foolish. [9] —Wyman, to Davos Seaworth     My son Wendel came to the the Twins a guest. He ate Lord Walder 's bread and salt, and hung his sword upon the wall to feast with friends. And they murdered him. Murdered , I say, and may the Freys choke upon their fables. I drink with Jared , jape with Symond , promise Rhaegar the hand of my own beloved granddaughter ... but never think that means I have forgotten. The north remembers, Lord Davos. The north remembers, and the mummer's farce is almost done. My son is home. [9] —Wyman, to Davos Seaworth     The wolf will prove the boy is who we say he is, should the Dreadfort attempt to deny him. That is my price, Lord Davos. Smuggle me back my liege lord, and I will take Stannis Baratheon as my king. [9] —Wyman, to Davos Seaworth     The best pie you have ever tasted, my lords. Wash it down with Arbor gold and savor every bite. I know I shall . [11] —Wyman, to Roose Bolton , Hosteen Frey , and Aenys Frey     Hosteen : We know the man who did this. Killed this boy and all the rest. Not by his own hand, no. He is too fat and craven to do his own killing. But by his word. Do you deny it? Wyman : I confess ... I confess that I know little of this poor boy. Lord Ramsay's squire, was he not? How old was the lad? Hosteen : Nine, on his last nameday . Wyman : So young. Though mayhaps this was a blessing. Had he lived he would have grown up to be a Frey . [4] — Hosteen Frey and Wyman   Quotes  The great pig Manderly was too craven to leave White Harbor , or we would have brought him as well. [26] — Ramsay Snow after displaying the bodies of Rodrik Cassel , Leobald Tallhart , and Cley Cerwyn     If one head was enough to appease a prince of Dorne , a bag of them should be more than adequate for a fat northman wrapped in sealskins. [20] — Cersei Lannister 's thoughts     The fat man would like to kill us all, I do not doubt, but he does not have the belly for it, for all his girth. Under that sweaty flesh beats a heart as craven and cringing as ... well ... yours. [11] — Barbrey Dustin , to Theon Greyjoy     Aenys : We must look at Manderly. Lord Wyman loves us not. Roger : He loves his steaks and chops and meat pies, though. Prowling the castle by dark would require him to leave the table. The only time he does that is when he seeks the privy for one of his hourlong squats. [24] — Aenys Frey and Roger Ryswell     Stannis : Wyman Manderly. Lord Too-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse. Too fat to come to me, yet he comes to Winterfell . Too fat to bend the knee and swear me his sword, yet now he wields that sword for Bolton . I sent my Onion Lord to treat with him, and Lord Too-Fat butchered him and mounted his head and hands on the walls of White Harbor for the Frey to gloat over. And the Freys ... has the Red Wedding been forgotten? Theon : The north remembers. The Red Wedding, Lady Hornwood's fingers, the sack of Winterfell , Deepwood Motte and Torrhen's Square , they remember all of it.
