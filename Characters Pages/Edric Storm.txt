He resembles his father, King Robert I , and has the characteristic hair, eyes, jaw, and cheekbones of House Baratheon . [2] Edric also has the large ears common to House Florent . [3] [4]  Edric is charming and courteous, but also fierce and proud. [2] [4] In this manner, Davos Seaworth compares Edric to both Robert and the king's brother, Renly . [5]   History  Edric was conceived by King Robert I Baratheon and Delena on the wedding night of Lord Stannis Baratheon to Selyse Florent , Delena's cousin, in the couple's wedding bed. Stannis saw this as an insult to his honor, so he sent Edric to Storm's End to foster with the boy's other uncle, Renly Baratheon . [6] As Delena was a noblewoman, Edric was acknowledged by his father. [7] [3] He was raised in relative comfort at Storm's End under the guardianship of Ser Cortnay Penrose , Renly's castellan , who is fond of the boy. [8] Edric was educated by maesters , castellans, and masters-at-arms. [4]  Edric has been sent a gift from his father every year on his name day . These have included a pony, a sable cloak, and a child-sized warhammer similar to his father's weapon. Edric would write to King's Landing to thank his father for the gifts, but upon receiving the letters Robert would laugh and ask Varys what he had sent that year. [5]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones  After having discovered Gendry , Lord Eddard Stark thinks about all of King Robert I Baratheon 's bastards that he knows about, Edric included. [7]   A Clash of Kings  Stannis Baratheon intends to use Edric's appearance as proof that Queen Cersei Lannister 's children were fathered by her brother, Ser Jaime Lannister , instead of King Robert. [3]  During the siege of Storm's End after the death of Renly Baratheon , Stannis offers to let the garrison go free if Edric is surrendered. Renly's castellan, Ser Cortnay Penrose , resists in fear of what Stannis would do to Edric, however. After Cortnay falls to his death, [9] Stannis takes the castle and ships Edric and Melisandre to Dragonstone . [10]   A Storm of Swords  Edric spends time at Dragonstone with Stannis's daughter, Princess Shireen Baratheon , and her fool, Patchface . [2] Maester Pylos leeches Edric when the boy comes down with a chill. [5] Edric remains faithful to the Faith of the Seven instead of converting to the worship of R'hllor . [11]  Melisandre pressures Stannis to burn Edric, as she believes that sacrificing his royal blood would wake dragons from stone to help Stannis. Conversely, Ser Davos Seaworth pressures Stannis to spare him. [4] Edric is leeched and his blood is used in a ritual to curse the three rival kings, Joffrey Baratheon , Balon Greyjoy , and Robb Stark . [5] Subsequently, Balon falls at Pyke , [12] Robb is killed in the Red Wedding , [13] and Joffrey is poisoned at his royal wedding . [14]  Concerned that Stannis will burn Edric, Davos, with the help of Pylos and a small group of king's men , has Edric secretly shipped away to the Free Cities aboard the Mad Prendos . The boy wants to give his farewalls to Shireen and Stannis, but Davos, speaking as the Hand of the King , insists there is no time. [11] Davos appoints Andrew Estermont , Edric's cousin, to act as his guardian. Gerald Gower , Triston of Tally Hill , Lewys the Fishwife , and Omer Blackberry also accompany Edric as his guards and protectors. [15] Davos defends his actions to a tired Stannis and a disappointed Melisandre, [11] and the king sails north to aid the Night's Watch . [16]   A Feast for Crows  Edric sails across the narrow sea past the Stepstones [17] to Essos on the Mad Prendos with Andrew and other protectors. [18]   A Dance with Dragons  Edric is in hiding in Lys with his guardian and protectors. [15]   Quotes by Edric  I won't go pray to the Lord of Light . I am a Warrior 's man, like my father . [11]  - Edric to Pylos    Andrew : I shall go with you, Cousin. There's nothing to be frightened of.  Edric : I am not frightened. [11]  - Andrew Estermont and Edric   Davos : You are Robert's son so I know you will be brave, no matter what happens.  Edric : I will. Only ...  Davos : Think of this as an adventure, my lord. It's the start of your life's great adventure. May the Warrior defend you.   Edric : And may the Father judge you justly, Lord Davos. [11]  - Davos Seaworth and Edric Quotes about Edric  Edric Storm, they call him. He is said to be the very image of my brother . If men were to see him, and then look again at Joffrey and Tommen , they could not help but wonder, I would think. [3]  - Stannis Baratheon to Davos Seaworth    Did the boy charm you? He has that gift. He got it from his father , with the blood. He knows he is a king’s son, but chooses to forget that he is bastard -born. [5]  – Stannis Baratheon to Davos Seaworth    Penrose chose to die rather than give him up. It still angers me. How could he think I would hurt the boy? I chose Robert , did I not? When that hard day came. I chose blood over honor. [5]  – Stannis Baratheon to Davos Seaworth    The Lord of Light cherishes the innocent. There is no sacrifice more precious. From his king's blood and his untainted fire, a dragon shall be born. [4]  – Melisandre to Stannis Baratheon    Davos: His name is Edric Storm, sire.  Stannis: I know his name. Was there ever a name so apt? It proclaims his bastardy , his high birth, and the turmoil he brings with him. Edric Storm. There, I have said it. Are you satisfied, my lord Hand ?  Davos : Edric—   Stannis : —is one boy! He may be the best boy who ever drew breath and it would not matter. My duty is to the realm . [4]  – Davos Seaworth and Stannis Baratheon    If Stannis is Azor Ahai come again, does that mean Edric Storm must play the part of Nissa Nissa ? [4]  – Davos Seaworth 's thoughts   Davos : I am speaking of a boy, your daughter's friend, your brother's son.  Melisandre : A king's son, with the power of kingsblood in his veins. Do you think you've saved this boy, Onion Knight? When the long night falls, Edric Storm shall die with the rest, wherever he is hidden. Your own sons as well. Darkness and cold will cover the earth. You meddle in matters you do not understand.
