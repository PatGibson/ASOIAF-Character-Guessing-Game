[5] His heavy black hair is thick on his chest, and coarse around his sex. [6] He is a very tall man; [5]  Eddard Stark estimates his height to be six and a half feet. [7] As a young adult, Robert was a handsome, [5] clean-shaven man, [7] with rough and hard hands. [8] He was strong and powerful, and muscled "like a maiden's fantasy". However, after he won the Iron Throne , Robert's appearance changed. Due to excessive feasting and drinking, Robert gained a significant amount of weight. In the nine years since Greyjoy's Rebellion , he gained at least eight stone in weight. [7] Now, he is often red-faced from drink, [9] with dark circles underneath his eyes, [7] and walks as if he is half in his cups, while sweating through his silks. [9] Robert's beard, a wild, thick and fierce thing, [10] hides his double chin. [7]  Well loved by soldiers, [10] [11] Robert is brave, but headstrong, rash, and impatient. [12] [13] [7] [14] [15] He is proud, [16] and will not likely back down on words spoken in a drunken bravado. [16] As king, Robert is no longer used to someone disagreeing with him, [17] and he can be manipulated by others if advised not to do something. [16]  Tyrion Lannister considers Robert to be a great blustering oaf, [18] while Varys describes him as a fool. [16]  Cersei Lannister considers her husband to be an ignorant, [19] dumb, [20] [6] slow-witted, [21] drunken brute of a man, [6] who does not have the ruthless streak she believes a king requires. [6] Although several people consider Robert to be brave, [12] [22] Cersei believes him to be a coward. [19] According to Petyr Baelish , Robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see. [23]  Robert is as strong as a bull and fearless in battle. [24] He loves the song of swords [25] and considers poison to be a coward's weapon. [17] As long they are honest and brave, Robert can be merciful towards his enemies, [17] [26] and he can inspire loyalty and friendship in those he spares. [27] The only exception are the Targaryens ; [17] his hatred for them is a madness within him. [14] A peerless warrior in his youth, [9] Robert fought with a spiked iron warhammer, crafted at Storm's End by Donal Noye , [28] although he also carried a blade. [29] In battle, he wore a great antlered helmet, which made him look like a horned god. [5] He prefers melees, in which he can hit people with his hammer, over jousts. [21] Despite the numerous weapons in the royal armory, the only blade Robert uses is a hunting knife he received as a boy from Jon Arryn , his foster father. [30] Although his condition has deteriorated due to his weight gain and frequent drinking, [7] Robert remains a strong man; Jaime Lannister believes that Robert is stronger than him. [31] Robert possesses a powerful battlefield voice. [16]  Robert is a man of huge appetites, who knows how to take his pleasures. [7] He is quite promiscuous, [32] and has fathered multiple bastard children. His lusts are the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realms, [33] As king, Robert is not loath to impose upon the hospitality of his subjects, no matter whether it is voluntarily or forced. [34] At the same time, however, Robert possesses a great, but rather careless, generosity. [35] He is an avid hunter. [36] [37] Some of Robert's favorite songs are " A Cask of Ale ", " Fifty-Four Tuns ", and " The Bear and the Maiden Fair ". [25]  Robert owns a black velvet doublet decorated with a crowned golden stag, [13] a green doublet, [15] and a golden mantle with a cloak of black and gold squares. [13] When riding his horse, Robert wears thick brown gloves and a hooded heavy fur cloak. [14]   History  Early life  Born in 262 AC , [2] Robert was the first born child of Cassana Estermont and Steffon Baratheon , Lord of Storm's End , Lord Paramount of the Stormlands , and head of House Baratheon . He was a scant year older than his brother, Stannis , who was born in 264 AC . [38] When Robert was already in his teens, his youngest brother, Renly , was born. [39]  According to Stannis, when Robert was five or six years old, the two brothers were brought to court by their father, Steffon, where they witnessed the Hand of the King , Lord Tywin Lannister , sitting on the Iron Throne and holding court. [40]  From an early age onwards, Robert had been fostered by Lord Jon Arryn in the Eyrie , together with Eddard Stark of Winterfell . The two boys became fast friends, and Jon Arryn, who had no children of his own, became like a second father to them. [36] [3] During the period in which he was fostered, Robert visited Storm's End on multiple occasions. [3] At some point, Robert was knighted . [1] During a tourney at Storm's End , Robert was defeated by Ser Barristan Selmy . [41]  After reaching manhood, Robert divided his time between Storm's End and the Eyrie. [42] In 278 AC , Robert's father was sent on a mission by King Aerys II Targaryen , to travel to Volantis to find a bride for Robert's cousin, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen . The mission failed, and Steffon, accompanied by his wife, returned home. [2] Robert and Stannis watched their parents' ship, Windproud , sink in a storm in Shipbreaker Bay while nearing Storm's End. [10] With his father's death, Robert became the Lord of Storm's End.  Lyanna Stark  Robert fell in love with Lyanna Stark , Eddard's younger sister. [7] In time, Lyanna's father, Lord Rickard Stark of Winterfell , agreed to betroth her to Robert. [32] At the time of their betrothal, Robert already had a bastard daughter, Mya Stone , in the Vale of Arryn , which led to Lyanna commenting that Robert would never keep to one bed, despite his love for her. [32] Eddard would later state that Robert saw only Lyanna's beauty, and never recognized her boldness and strength of will. [16]  In 281 AC , Robert was present at the tourney at Harrenhal , where he took part in the melee. [5] He held a drinking contest with Ser Richard Lonmouth , and swore to unmask the mystery knight known as the Knight of the Laughing Tree , although he failed to do so. [43] It was Robert's cousin, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen , who won the final joust of the tourney. The prince crowned Lyanna—by then long betrothed to Robert—the queen of love and beauty , instead of his wife, Princess Elia Martell . There are some who say that Robert had laughed, stating that Rhaegar had only paid Lyanna her due, though according to men who knew Robert better, he felt it had been an insult, on which he brooded long, causing him to harden against Rhaegar. [44]  The next year, Prince Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna, [7] [44] which set in motion a chain of events leading to Robert's Rebellion . [1]   Robert's Rebellion  Main article: Robert's Rebellion  News of Lyanna Stark 's kidnapping led her eldest brother, Brandon , and later her father, Lord Rickard , to King's Landing demanding justice. Both were executed by order of King Aerys II Targaryen , who then demanded that the heads of Robert and Eddard Stark , wards of Lord Jon Arryn at the Eyrie . Jon refused, however, and rose up in rebellion instead, with Eddard (now Lord of Winterfell following the deaths of his father and older brother) and Robert rallying the north and the stormlands respectively. [36] Not all of Arryn's bannermen supported the rebellion, however. Robert fought at Gulltown , where Marq Grafton and other loyalists from the Vale blocked the port. Robert slew Marq [45] and sailed back home to Storm's End to call his banners. [14] [1]    Young Robert at the battles at Summerhall ( Game of Thrones History and Lore).  However, some of his own remained loyal to the throne. When Robert learned that Lords Grandison , Cafferen , and Fell had gathered their hosts and planned to join forces at Summerhall in order to march on Storm's End, he rode ahead with his knights. He fought each of the lords in turn, defeating them all. [40] Robert returned to Storm's End with his captives, and there won the loyalty of Lords Cafferen and Grandison, as well as, Silveraxe Fell , the son of Lord Fell whom Robert had slain. [40] [27]  Free to march north so he could join forces with Jon Arryn and the northmen, [1] Robert marched out again, leaving his younger brother Stannis in charge of Storm's End. Stannis was torn between loyalty to his brother or to the king, ultimately siding with his family. [27] Lord Randyll Tarly fell upon Robert with his van and defeated Robert's forces at the battle of Ashford , before Lord Mace Tyrell could arrive with the main force from the Reach . [46] Robert escaped capture with the bulk of his forces, [3] however, and continued his journey north. Aerys wanted someone young and vigorous to match Robert, and so replaced Lod Owen Merryweather with Lord Jon Connington as his Hand of the King . [47] [48] Connington personally led a mighty army into the field, giving chase to Robert, whose march became grueling. [3] Wounded and separated from his men, [49] [29] Robert took refuge at Stoney Sept . [49] When Connington and his army arrived at the town and began searching the houses, the residents actively aided Robert, keeping him hidden from the king's men. In the end, they hid him in a brothel. [29] When Lords Eddard Stark and Hoster Tully arrived with a rebel army, Robert came out of hiding and fought with Connington, almost killing him. [29] One of Robert's bastard children, Bella , fathered upon a whore in the whorehouse, was named after the Battle of the Bells . [49]  King Aerys began to realize that Robert was the greatest threat to the Targaryen dynasty since Daemon I Blackfyre , and exiled Connington, naming Lord Qarlton Chelsted as his Hand in Connington's stead. [50] To secure the aid of House Tully , Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark married Lord Hoster's daughters, Lysa and Catelyn . [7] Robert attended the wedding at Riverrun . [3]    Robert fighting Prince Rhaegar , as depicted by Justin Sweet in The World of Ice & Fire  Robert led the rebel forces during the Battle of the Trident , the decisive battle near war's end. Around this time, Robert proclaimed his intention to claim the Iron Throne . [51] Out of all three leaders of the rebellion, Robert had the better claim, [16] due to the fact that his grandmother had been Princess Rhaelle Targaryen , the youngest daughter of King Aegon V Targaryen . [52] To justify Robert's claim, the maesters would later use his bloodties to House Targaryen , [53] though it was conquest which won him the throne. In 283 AC [N 1] the rebel and loyalist forces fought at a place that became known as the ruby ford , located on the northern bank of the Trident . [54] Robert and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen met on horseback in single combat, with the battle raging on all around them. [7] Rhaegar wounded Robert [14] before Robert killed Rhaegar with a blow to the chest from his warhammer. [7] Eventually, the Targaryen host broke and ran. [14] When Lord Roose Bolton advised Robert to execute Ser Barristan Selmy , a captured knight of Aerys's Kingsguard , Robert refused, and instead had his own maester treat the wounds of Barristan the Bold. [17]  Himself wounded and unable to chase the loyalists, [14] [1] Robert gave the pursuit of the remnants of the Targaryen army to Lord Stark. Leading the van, Eddard followed the loyalists back to King's Landing. [14] [50] However, Lord Tywin Lannister had arrived earlier with an army, which began attacking the city after Grand Maester Pycelle convinced Aerys to admit them within the gates. [50] Aerys was slain in the Sack of King's Landing by Ser Jaime Lannister , Tywin's son and a member of the Kingsguard. [14] After Robert arrived in King's Landing, Tywin presented him with the mutilated bodies of Princess Elia Martell , Rhaegar's wife, and their two young children, Princess Rhaenys and Prince Aegon . While Robert was pleased they were dead, Eddard was outraged and disgusted by the act, calling it murder, and saying the young prince and princess were no more than babes. Robert's response was, "I see no babes, only dragonspawn ." [14] The argument led to Eddard leaving King's Landing the next day, to fight the final battles alone. It took the death of Lyanna and their shared grief to reunite the pair in friendship. [14] Robert was thereafter haunted by Lyanna's memory and the desire for further vengeance against the slain Rhaegar. [7]   Rebellion's Aftermath   Coronation of King Robert Baratheon by Henning Ludvigsen © Fantasy Flight Games  In late 283 AC , Robert was crowned king. He chose his second father, [36] Lord Jon Arryn , as his Hand of the King . [55] Pardoning many of his former enemies, Robert appointed Ser Barristan Selmy as the Lord Commander of his Kingsguard . Despite Eddard Stark urging Robert to strip Ser Jaime Lannister of his white cloak, Robert listened to Jon's advice, and pardoned Jaime together with the master of whisperers , Lord Varys , and the Grand Maester , Pycelle , [56] and Jaime continued to serve in the Kingsguard along with Barristan. [18] At his coronation feast, Robert joked to Jaime about the fact that Jaime was already being called "kingslayer". [50] Robert allowed Ser Ronald Connington to keep Griffin's Roost , although Robert kept the gold [57] and most of House Connington 's lands were granted to neighbors. [29] Robert replaced the skulls of the Targaryen dragons in the Red Keep 's throne room with banners and tapestries depicting hunting and battle. [58] [59] [60]  Robert tasked his brother Stannis with building a new royal fleet and capturing Dragonstone , the last Targaryen-loyalist stronghold, where the pregnant Dowager Queen Rhaella Targaryen and her son Viserys remained. Stannis led the assault on Dragonstone some nine months [N 2] after the Trident, but Viserys and the newly-born Daenerys Targaryen had been smuggled from the island shortly before by Ser Willem Darry . Robert blamed Stannis for letting the Targaryen children escape, even though the two children had been spirited to safety by Targaryen loyalists shortly before Stannis had set sail. [10] [61] [62]  As he now resided in King's Landing , Robert granted the ancestral Baratheon seat of Storm's End to his youngest brother, Renly , while naming Stannis as Lord of Dragonstone . Both Stannis and Queen Cersei Lannister believe that Robert intended this as a slight against Stannis, [10] [62] but according to George R. R. Martin Robert had not necessarily meant it as such. [35] Dragonstone had traditionally been the seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, the Prince of Dragonstone , during most of the Targaryen dynasty, so the then-childless Robert was granting it to his heir at that time, Stannis. [35] Stannis became the head of House Baratheon of Dragonstone , with Robert heading House Baratheon of King's Landing  Although peace returned to the Seven Kingdoms , many of those who did not support Robert referred to him as the Usurper . Dorne never forgot or forgave that Robert condoned the murders of Princess Elia Martell and her two young children, Princess Rhaenys and Prince Aegon . The year after Robert took the throne, Elia's younger brother, Prince Oberyn , began plotting a rebellion in the name of the exiled Viserys. Lord Jon Arryn , Robert's new Hand of the King , travelled to Dorne, sat down with Doran Martell , the Prince of Dorne , and ended all talk of rebellion. Regardless, Robert never visited Dorne. [63]   Marriage  Though Robert had no wish to marry after Lyanna Stark 's death, the realm needed an heir, and Lord Jon Arryn suggested that Robert marry Lady Cersei Lannister , the only daughter of Lord Tywin Lannister , to ensure political stability and Tywin's support should Viserys Targaryen ever attempt to win back his throne. [16] Robert and Cersei were married in 284 AC [64] in the Great Sept of Baelor , [37] with Robert draping her with a heavy golden cloak decorated with an onyx stag. [65] A tourney was held to celebrate the wedding . [41] However, during their wedding night, a drunken Robert accidentally whispered, "Lyanna" into Cersei's ear while consummating the marriage , an act that would set the tone for their marriage. [26] That was the only night when sex between Robert and Cersei was consensual. [6]  While Robert "claimed his rights" frequently during the early years of their marriage, his drinking led to him hurting Cersei during those encounters. When she confronted him once during their first year of marriage, Robert claimed it was because of the drink, and he was not to blame. According to Robert, he did not remember anything of those nights, but according to Cersei, Robert did recall what he did to her, but felt that pretending to have forgotten was easier than facing the truth. Over time, Robert came to Cersei's bed less frequently, not even once a year. [6] Cersei began to loathe her husband, [18] and her cold attitude towards him created a distance between them. [16] Robert remained in love with Lyanna for years after her death, [66] placing further strain upon the marriage. Cersei has had an incestuous relationship with her twin brother, Jaime Lannister , for years, and they continued their illicit relationship after Cersei's marriage to Robert. Although Robert often urged Cersei to join his hunts in the early years of their marriage, Cersei refused so she could discretely be with her brother. [67] Two of Robert's Estermont uncles had spent half a year at court following his wedding, and Robert insisted on repaying the visit. They remained on Greenstone for a fortnight. There, Robert slept with his cousin, and upon learning this, Cersei had sex with Jaime whilst in the castle. [21]  Cersei gave birth to three children: Prince Joffrey , born in 286 AC , Princess Myrcella , born in 289 AC , and Prince Tommen , born in 290 AC . [68] Though everyone, including Robert, believed them to be Robert's children, Jaime is the biological father of all three. [26] Robert did not attend any of the births; whenever Cersei's time was due, he left for a hunt, returning only after the birth. [69] Cersei became pregnant by Robert only once. Refusing to give birth to Robert's child, she had Jaime find a woman to cleanse her. [26]   Reign   Balon Greyjoy kneels before King Robert Baratheon ( Game of Thrones History and Lore)  Six years after taking the crown, Robert joined forces with his Warden of the North , Lord Eddard Stark , and his Warden of the West , Lord Tywin Lannister , to crush Greyjoy's Rebellion , which lasted less than a year. Robert and Ned fought side by side during the siege of Pyke , [70] after which the king knighted Jacelyn Bywater [71] and Lord Jorah Mormont . [72]  Balon Greyjoy , self-proclaimed King of the Iron Islands , submitted to Robert, who allowed the ironman to remain Lord of the Iron Islands , although Eddard took Balon's heir, Theon , as hostage. [7] [73] To celebrate his victory, Robert ordained that a tourney should be held outside Lannisport . [72]  Robert does not like his kingship; [17] according to Donal Noye , Robert changed by becoming king, and not for the better. [74] He finds business concerning coin, crop, or justice tedious. [23] Robert barely attends small council sessions, [23] [33] [18] preferring to hunt and hawk instead, [21] [18] and when he does attend, he usually dozes through them. [21] He leaves the task of ruling to his small council, [23] mostly to Lord Jon Arryn , his Hand of the King , and to Lord Stannis Baratheon , his younger brother and the master of ships . [21] [10] Robert loathes "counting coppers", [23] [14] but loves to organize tournaments and feasts, and so has beggared the realm. [23] Despite the fact that King Aerys II Targaryen had left treasure vaults overflowing with gold, Robert's spending has left the crown in debt of over six million golden dragons (borrowing heavily from the Lannisters , the Tyrells , the Faith , and the Iron Bank of Braavos ). [23] Silver stags have been minted with Robert's face on one side and the stag on the reverse. [48]  Though Robert loves him, [16] he does not have a close bond with his heir, Prince Joffrey Baratheon . [37] Robert disliked that Joffrey always cried when he picked him up as a babe, as his bastard children gurgled at him happily. [69] Nor was he fond of Joffrey's nature. [16] For instance, when Joffrey cut open a pregnant cat to see if there were kittens inside its belly and then shown his father what he'd done, Robert hit the boy, knocking out two of his teeth. [75] [76] Robert claims he has dreamed of giving up his crown, but that the thought of Joffrey on the throne with Cersei whispering in his ear has stopped him. [16]  Due to his frequent whoring, Robert has sired several bastards during his marriage to Cersei, though he has kept them out of sight. According to a prophecy by Maggy the Frog , Robert has fathered sixteen children. [77] However, Robert has acknowledged only one bastard, [16] and Lord Varys , the master of whisperers , knows of the existence of eight. [78] The eldest, Mya Stone , was born to Robert while he was still in the Vale of Arryn . [16] Robert once suggested bringing Mya to court after Prince Joffrey assaulted the cat. When Cersei threatened the girl's life, Robert hit his wife, but he refrained from for bringing Mya to court. [79]  Bella was conceived during Robert's Rebellion , [49] and Gendry shortly after the rebellion had ended, to a worker in an alehouse in King’s Landing . According to Lord Petyr Baelish , Robert also fathered twins on a serving woman at Casterly Rock , but the two were killed on the orders of Queen Cersei. [32] During the wedding of his younger brother Stannis to Lady Selyse of House Florent , Robert deflowered Delena , a cousin of Selyse, on the wedding bed. According to Robert, he was too drunk to know which bed it was. This coupling led to the birth of Edric Storm , the only acknowledged bastard of the king. [32] Robert enjoys visiting Edric at Storm's End, although gifts for the boy are chosen by Varys. [27] The youngest of Robert's baseborn children is Barra , a babe born to a prostitute in King's Landing. [32]  Ser Justin Massey developed his lustiness while squiring for Robert. [80]  Richard Horpe hoped to join Robert's Kingsguard , but Cersei convinced her husband to refuse Richard. [80] The king's current squires are Lancel and Tyrek Lannister , cousins of Queen Cersei. [16] Lord Stark names his firstborn son Robb and Lord Arryn names his sole surviving child Robert . [7] Jon Arryn's favorite falcon is a gift from the king. [81] Robert became goods friends with Thoros of Myr , [82] laughing at the red priest 's flaming sword, [83] and he keeps Jalabhar Xho at court as a curiosity. [84] During the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day , Robert won a Valyrian steel dagger from Lord Petyr Baelish by betting against Jaime, who was defeated by Ser Loras Tyrell in the lists. [56] [85] The largest warship in the royal fleet is King Robert's Hammer , and Robert named Lady Lyanna after his lost love . [86]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones   Robert and Eddard Stark leaving Winterfell by Tomasz Jedruszek © Fantasy Flight Games  When his Hand of the King , Lord Jon Arryn , dies suddenly, Robert decides to offer the position to his old childhood friend, Eddard Stark , Lord of Winterfell . [36] Displeased that he was not chosen, [87]  Stannis Baratheon , Robert's younger brother, sails from King's Landing to his own seat of Dragonstone . [23]  Traveling with a large retinue to the north , Robert insists upon paying his respects at the tomb of Lyanna Stark within the crypt of Winterfell . [7] The king offers a betrothal between his own son, Prince Joffrey , and Eddard's eldest daughter, Sansa . Eddard is shocked how much Robert has changed since he last saw him, at the end of Greyjoy's Rebellion . [7] Eddard reluctantly accepts the position of Hand. [88] While Robert and Eddard are away hunting, Bran Stark discovers Queen Cersei Lannister and her twin, Ser Jaime Lannister of Robert's Kingsguard , in the First Keep . Jaime throws Bran from the tower, [66] leaving the boy crippled and comatose. [89] A catspaw later attempts to assassinate Bran with a Valyrian steel dagger . [90]  While riding through the barrowlands , Robert discusses the marriage of the exiled Princess Daenerys Targaryen to Drogo , a khal of the Dothraki , and the king is uncertain about Ned's opinion that the marriage does not represent a danger. [14] At Castle Darry , after Joffrey has been attacked by Arya Stark 's direwolf, Nymeria , Robert is willing to call the incident simply an argument between two children. As the direwolf has disappeared, the beast cannot be executed. When Cersei suggests Sansa's direwolf, Lady , be executed instead, Robert does nothing to stop it, despite loathing the suggestion. [91] Robert does not wish to face Eddard and spends the remaining fortnight of the journey drunk in Cersei's wheelhouse. [23]  Renly Baratheon , Lord of Storm's End and Robert's youngest brother, plots with House Tyrell to have Robert replace Cersei as queen with Margaery Tyrell , daughter of Mace Tyrell , Lord of Highgarden . [92] Ser Loras Tyrell hopes his sister would remind Robert of the love of his youth, Lyanna. [33]  Against Ned's wishes, Robert decides to host a tourney for his friend's appointment as Hand of the King. [23] The king plans to fight in the melee portion of the Hand's tourney , loudly shouting at Cersei when she openly attempts to forbid him. [93] Eddard and Ser Barristan Selmy convince him that the fight would be unfair, as every contestant would let their king win, which angers Robert, as it touches on his pride. He eventually does not participate in the melee. [16] Lord Varys later tells Eddard that Cersei had planned to have Robert killed during the melee. [16] Robert confesses to Eddard that he dreams about giving up his crown and journeying to the Free Cities as a sellsword to spend his life warring and whoring, but he worries about Cersei's influence on Joffrey. [16]  When Robert calls a meeting to demand the assassination of Daenerys, who is now pregnant with Drogo's child, Eddard resigns in protest. [17] After Eddard is injured in an ambush led by Jaime, [32] Robert visits his friend and gives him back his badge of office, stating that if Eddard refuses to take it, Robert will pin it on Jaime. [13]  Accompanied by Renly, Barristan, Joffrey, Sandor Clegane , Ser Balon Swann , Lord Yohn Royce , and other nobles, Robert goes hunting in the kingswood for a white hart. [59] [26] Eddard holds court and meets with Raymun Darry , Marq Piper , and Karyl Vance , knights from the riverlands . In Robert's name, Ned sends Lord Beric Dondarrion to apprehend Ser Gregor Clegane , who is accused of brigandry. [59] Having investigated Robert's bastards and discovered Gendry [33] and Barra , [32] Eddard comes to the realization that Robert's royal children are actually Cersei's bastards born of incest with her brother, Jaime. [26] Knowing that Robert will kill Cersei and the children in his wroth, Eddard advises her to flee, but she refuses. [26]    King Robert on his deathbed by Chris Dien © Fantasy Flight Games  Cersei had given Robert's squire, Lancel Lannister , a fortified strongwine, three times as potent as normal, to give to Robert during his hunt. [18] Robert drunkenly insists on facing a monstrous boar alone, but the king is mortally gored in the process. [15] Robert is brought back to King's Landing, where he has Eddard write him his will. Robert names him Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm , to serve until Joffrey comes of age. Eddard, unable to tell Robert about Cersei's infidelity, changes the wording in Robert's will, replacing "my son Joffrey" with "my heir". [15] Robert dies the next day. [60] According to Varys, if it had not been the boar which killed Robert, it would have been a fall from a horse or an arrow gone astray, as Cersei needed Robert to die during the hunt. [5] The bells of the Great Sept of Baelor toll in the city to announce his death. [94] After Cersei tears up Robert's will in the throne room, Eddard announces that Joffrey has no claim to the throne and that Stannis is the true heir as Robert's younger brother.

[10] [99]  With Robert dead, Balon Greyjoy declares independence for the Iron Islands during the War of the Five Kings , proclaiming himself King of the Isles and the North . [100]  Yoren helps Gendry flee the capital.

[103] [104]  King Joffrey dies at his wedding feast [105] and is succeeded by his younger brother, King Tommen I Baratheon . [106] Tyrion deduces that Joffrey had stolen the Valyrian dagger from Robert's armory, [105] and Jaime concludes that Joffrey tried to kill Bran Stark in a misguided attempt to impress Robert. [106]  Lord Davos Seaworth helps Edric Storm flee Dragonstone . [76]   A Feast for Crows  Cersei, the Queen Regent for Tommen, thinks she makes a better king than Robert.

No Greyjoy ever swore an oath to a Baratheon . Robert : Swear one now, or lose that stubborn head of yours. [73] — Balon Greyjoy and Robert     The gods be damned. It was a hollow victory they gave me. A crown ... it was the girl I prayed them for. Your sister, safe ... and mine again, as she was meant to be. I ask you, Ned, what good is it to wear a crown? The gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike. [14] —Robert to Eddard Stark     Eddard: You're too fat for your armor, Robert.  Robert: Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your king? Ah, damn you, Ned, why are you always right? [16] —Robert to Eddard Stark     I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne , or so dead as now that I've won it. [16] —Robert to Eddard Stark     STOP THIS MADNESS, IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING! [16] —Robert to Gregor and Sandor Clegane     I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for fighting well. [17] —Robert to Roose Bolton     Robert:  The realm ... the realm knows ... what a wretched king I've been. Bad as Aerys , the gods spare me.  Eddard: No, not as bad as Aerys, Your Grace. Not near so bad as Aerys. [15] —Robert and Eddard Stark   Quotes about Robert  The king was a great disappointment to Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident , the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his silks. He walked like a man half in his cups. [9] —thoughts of Jon Snow     The eunuch had hit upon a truth; tell Robert Baratheon he could not, should not, or must not do a thing, and it was as good as done. [16] —thoughts of Eddard Stark     Robert was never the same after he put on that crown. Some men are like swords, made for fighting. Hang them up and they go to rust. [74] — Donal Noye to Jon Snow     They said Robert Baratheon was strong as a bull and fearless in battle, a man who loved nothing better than war. [24] —thoughts of Daenerys Targaryen     Robert wanted smiles and cheers, always, so he went where he found them, to his friends and his whores . Robert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same disease. [69] — Cersei Lannister to Sansa Stark     Sandor : Robert is the king of the worms now. Is that why you're down in the earth , to keep his court for him? Beric : The king is dead, but we are still king's men, though the royal banner we bore was lost at the Mummer's Ford when your brother's butchers fell upon us. Robert is slain, but his realm remains . And we defend her. [115] — Sandor Clegane and Beric Dondarrion     Robert ... He is in my dreams as well. Laughing. Drinking. Boasting. Those were the things he was best at. Those, and fighting. I never bested him at anything. [27] — Stannis Baratheon to Melisandre     It's not Aerys I rue, it's Robert ... Why is it no one names Robert oathbreaker? He tore the realm apart , yet I am the one with shit for honor. [50] — Jaime Lannister to Brienne of Tarth     Arys: Robert was no monster. Arianne: He climbed onto his throne over the corpses of children , though I will grant you he was no Joffrey . [116] — Arys Oakheart and Arianne Martell     Jaime : What do you know of sin, coz? I killed my king . Lancel The brave man slays with a sword, the craven with a wineskin. We are both kingslayers, ser. Jaime : Robert was no true king. Some might even say that a stag is a lion's natural prey. [34] — Jaime Lannister and Lancel Lannister     He was a good knight but a bad king, for he had no right to the throne he sat. [110] — Barristan Selmy to Daenerys Targaryen     We all know what my brother would do. Robert would gallop up to the gates of Winterfell alone, break them with his warhammer, and ride through the rubble to slay Roose Bolton with his left hand and the Bastard with his right. I am not Robert. But we will march , and we will free Winterfell ... or die in the attempt. [117] — Stannis Baratheon to Richard Horpe   Behind the Scenes  According to George R. R. Martin , Robert is partially inspired by Edward IV of England , [118] and he also has similarities with Henry VIII of England .
