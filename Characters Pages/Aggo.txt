He accompanies Daenerys during her visit to the Western Market in Vaes Dothrak . He helps stop an assassination attempt on Daenerys's life by a wineseller. [1]  When Daenerys attempts to heal Drogo with Mirri Maz Duur 's aid, his bloodriders attempt to stop her. Cohollo is prevented from slitting Daenerys's throat when he is killed by an arrow from Aggo. [2]  When Daenerys names Aggo ko and asks him to become one of her bloodriders alongside Jhogo and Rakharo , she offers him the dragonbone bow she received as a present during her wedding. He is at first reluctant, but he accepts after the dragons are born. [3]   A Clash of Kings  During their journey across the red waste , Aggo tells Daenerys that Drogon is Balerion the Black Dread reincarnated. [4]  While her khalasar rests in Vaes Tolorro after crossing the red waste, Daenerys orders her three bloodriders to scout out the country, each one in a different direction. Aggo leaves to the south-west, where he find nothing but sterile desert and the ruins of two abandoned cities, one of which is warded by skulls and the other where he finds an iron bracelet, which he brings back to Daenerys. [4] He is the second bloodrider to come back to Vaes Tolorro. After his return, Daenerys sets him to repairing the gates to defend the town should they come under attack. [4]  Aggo accompanies Daenerys to the House of the Undying , where he asks her to allow him and Jhogo to go with her and protect her as her sworn bloodrider, though Daenerys insists there are places even a khal must walk alone. [5]  Afterwards, Aggo, along with Jhogo , rides with Daenerys to Qarth's waterfront to seek a ship, where he buys a skewer of honey-roasted mice to eat. [6] He rushes to Daenerys's aid during her second near assassination attempt and seizes Arstan Whitebeard's staff. He draws his arakh on Strong Belwas when the latter mocks him, but he stands down on the orders of Daenerys. [6]   A Storm of Swords  Aggo guards Daenerys when she visits the Plaza of Pride to discuss the purchase of Unsullied slaves. [7] As one of Daenery's three bloodriders, he often is asked to keep her company as to prevent Jorah Mormont from approaching her when alone. [7]  He is present when Daenerys purchases and turns the Unsullied upon the slavers of Astapor . The night before the battle, Daenerys sees him fit a new string to his dragonbone bow, and recalls his opinion that Eroeh 's rape by Mago was the Lhazareen girl's fate. [8]  Aggo leads the litter during the Battle of Astapor, and feathers several Good Masters and Astapori slavers on the day of the battle with his great bow, calmly mowing down anyone with tokars with pinpoint precision. [8]  On the march to Yunkai , Aggo and his fellow bloodriders are also made kos by Daenerys and are put in charge of commanding the 30-odd mounted khalasar remaining to her, leaving their guarding duties to Arstan Whitebeard and Strong Belwas . Aggo later participates in the battle of Yunkai , successfully leading the Dothraki mounted warriors in wedge formation against the enemy center. [9]  During the siege of Meereen , Aggo almost comes to blows with Jhogo and Rakharo over who would fight Oznak zo Pahl , the Hero of Meereen; Daenerys ultimately stops her bloodriders from fighting, deeming them brave but too young and valuable to lose. [10]   A Dance with Dragons  Aggo, Jhogo and Rakharo are commanded by Daenerys to use her khalasar to subdue the hinterlands of Meereen and end the slavery there. [11] Ser Barristan later reports the bloodriders successfully harried the slavers from the hills and struck the shackles off the slaves, and are planting and bringing crops to Meereen to market. [12]  Daenerys later recalls Aggo and her other bloodriders back to Meereen. They arrive in time to assist her in feeding the thousands of survivors from the siege of Astapor , where Aggo expresses disgust at the cannibalism of the diseased refugees. He later watches in disbelief as Daenerys and his comrades help the sufferers of the bloody flux . [13]  Aggo later accompanies Daenerys to Daznak's Pit as part of the royal procession's guard. [14] He and Rakharo both depart Meereen and lead search parties across the Skahazadhan to locate Daenerys when she disappears on Drogon 's back. [15] Both lead ten picked riders and every man has three horses each to travel far and fast to find her. [16]
