 Harwin is the son of  Hullen , the master of horse at Winterfell. [4]  Harwin often led  Arya Stark 's pony around the yard of Winterfell during her youth, rode at quintain with  Jon Snow  and  Robb Stark , and was known for drinking too much on feast days. [5] 
 Harwin remembers  Lyanna Stark 's skills at horse-riding and was privy to the rumors of Lord  Eddard Stark  and  Ashara Dayne 's love affair as a young boy no older than Arya, suggesting he has been a stable-boy and guard of Winterfell in the service of  House Stark  since his youth. [6] [7]
