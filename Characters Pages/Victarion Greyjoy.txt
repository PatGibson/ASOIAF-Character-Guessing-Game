 Appearance and Character 
 See also:  Images of Victarion Greyjoy 
 Victarion is a large and powerful man, with a bull's broad chest and a boy's flat stomach. His hair is flecked with grey. [3] 
 Victarion is a capable commander and a fierce warrior in battle, but he has a calm demeanor outside of it, thinking of enemies who show bravery with great respect. [4]  He is a  religious  man and wears full plate armor while sailing because he has no fear of drowning. [3] [5]  According to  George R. R. Martin , Victarion is "dumb as a stump" [6]  and "a dullard and a brute". [7] 
 The Lord Captain's armor consists of boiled black leather, heavy grey chain mail, and lobstered plate, and his helm is in the shape of a  kraken . [3] [5]  He carries a longsword and a dirk, [3]  but prefers to use his axe. [8] [5]  Victarion's cloak is made of nine layers of gold cloth sewn like the kraken of his House, and its arms reach his boots. [3] 
 
 History 
   Victarion Greyjoy coming ashore leading his  ironborn  men - by Matt Olson © 
 Victarion and his two eldest brothers,  Balon  and  Euron , convinced their father  Quellon ,  Lord of the Iron Islands , to join  Robert's Rebellion , and they raided the  Reach  late in the war. After Quellon was killed in a  battle at the Mander , however, the new Lord Balon returned to the  Iron Islands  with his younger brothers. [9] [10] 
 Victarion recognized the greatness of Balon and followed him loyally. He commanded the great fleet constructed by Balon, the  Iron Fleet , during  Greyjoy's Rebellion . During the rebellion, using a plan Euron had concocted, they sailed into  Lannisport  and  burned the Lannister fleet  at anchor. [11]  Victarion tossed the first torch onto the flagship of Lord  Tywin Lannister . [3]  Later in the rebellion, the Iron Fleet was smashed by  Stannis Baratheon  in a  sea battle off Fair Isle , during which Victarion's younger brother  Aeron's  vessel,  Golden Storm , was chopped in half by Stannis's warship,  Fury . [9]  After the rebellion's end, Victarion continued to serve faithfully as  Lord Captain .
 Victarion has wed three times: his first wife died in childbirth, birthing a stillborn daughter; his second wife was stricken by a pox;  his third wife  was seduced and impregnated by his brother  Euron , which drove Victarion to beat her to death to retain his honor. Only the taboo against  kinslaying  kept Victarion from doing the same to Euron. He has not married since, nor has he forgiven Euron, who was forced into exile by Balon in  297 AC . [3] [11] [9]  In addition to his third wife, Victarion has beaten four men to death with his fists. [3] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Clash of Kings 
 In preparation for the invasion of the  north  planned by his brother,  Balon Greyjoy , Victarion loans his steersman,  Rymolf Stormdrunk , to his nephew,  Theon Greyjoy . Victarion attends a feast at  Pyke 's Great Hall with his brothers, Balon and  Aeron . [11]  He is sent with the main strength of the  Iron Fleet  to take  Moat Cailin  by his king and brother,  Balon Greyjoy . [11]   Moat Cailin falls  to the  ironborn 's surprise assault. Theon intends to hold  Meera  and  Jojen Reed  captive to prevent their father, Lord  Howland Reed , from attacking Victarion's men, but the Reed children vanish from  Winterfell . [12] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
 Robb Stark , the  King in the North , is informed at  Hag's Mire  of Balon's death and the return of his exiled brother,  Euron Crow's Eye . Robb thinks that Victarion will leave Moat Cailin to claim Balon's throne. [13] 
 
 A Feast for Crow s 
 Victarion wears mail and leather day and night for protection from  crannogmen . He leaves a token force to defend Moat Cailin under the command of  Ralf Kenning  and returns to the  Iron Islands  with his fleet to decide on the succession of the next  iron king . [3] 
 Victarion makes a claim to the  Seastone Chair  as Balon's brother and second-in-command. He refuses the offer of his niece,  Asha Greyjoy , to share rule with him as king and her as his  Hand . [3]  Victarion makes a strong claim at the  kingsmoot , but the crowd ultimately favors  Euron . [8] 
 Despite his hatred for Euron, Victarion's obedient and dutiful nature keeps him following his king's orders. Victarion leads the  taking of the Shields , slaughtering unarmored sailors and winning a duel with Ser  Talbert Serry , the son of Lord  Osbert Serry , but his hand is wounded during the fight. After his victory, Victarion watches helplessly as Euron steals many of his trusted comrades away from him by giving them titles on the  Shield Islands . Victarion also deplores the cruelty Euron displays toward the slain lords' women. [5] 
 Apparently oblivious to Victarion's hatred, Euron summons Victarion to a private meeting in  Lord Hewett's castle  and asks him to find  Daenerys Targaryen  and deliver Euron's marriage proposal. The new king explains that Victarion will receive the Seastone Chair once Euron claims the  Iron Throne . Victarion agrees, but secretly plans on courting Daenerys for himself. [5] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
   Victarion in plate armor - by Amok © 
 After the  yielding of Moat Cailin ,  Ramsay Bolton  executes the small garrison left behind by Victarion. [14] 
 Victarion's  Iron Fleet  of over ninety ships splits into three squadrons and sets sail for  Meereen . With him aboard  Iron Victory  is "the  dusky woman ", a gift of Euron's. She is comely but mute. On the journey, Victarion loses nearly half his ships, though he also gains some ships back by capturing and seizing several trading vessels and their cargo. Victarion's wounded hand continues to trouble him, and he suspects that  Kerwin , the  maester  that  Euron  sent to accompany him, is poisoning him.
 During the voyage, a  red priest  of  R'hllor  named  Moqorro  is discovered clinging to wreckage out at sea. The crew wants him killed, but Moqorro convinces Victarion to allow him to treat his wounded hand. Behind closed doors, Moqorro apparently uses magic on the lord captain; when Victarion emerges from his cabin, his hand is charred and blackened. [15] 
 Moqorro, like  Melisandre , can see the future in the flames, and uses the magic to aid Victarion in his quest. For instance, Victarion orders his crew to kill Kerwin, as Moqorro had a vision that the maester's death would bring the ship good winds. [15]  The  Iron Victory' s crew live in great fear of Moqorro and call him the Black Flame. Victarion makes offerings to both the  Drowned God  and R'hllor. Moqorro also alerts Victarion that he has seen Daenerys married in the flames, but Victarion is unconcerned by this, stating "she would not be the first woman I made a widow." [16]  Moqorro tells Victarion that in order to bind Daenerys's  dragons  to the Iron Captain's will, Victarion must claim the  dragon horn   Dragonbinder  with blood. [16]
