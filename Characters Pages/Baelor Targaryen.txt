He kept it cut short and kept his jaw clean-shaven. [3] His nose had been broken twice. [3]  Baelor was a warrior, and seemed to be all that could be wished in a knight, lord, or heir. He was also a man who could win respect with ease, and was as open-handed and just as his father. [4]  However, too many men looked upon Baelor's dark hair and eyes and muttered that he was more Martell than Targaryen. [4] Some Blackfyre sympathizers also were bothered by his namesake, "the feeblest king who ever sat the Iron Throne ". [2]   History  Early life  Prince Baelor was born in 170 AC , the first child of King Daeron II Targaryen and Mariah Martell . He won the name "Breakspear" in 187 AC at the age of seventeen, following his famous victory at Princess Daenerys 's wedding tourney , where he defeated Daemon Blackfyre in the final tilt. [4]   First Blackfyre Rebellion  When the First Blackfyre Rebellion was in its early stages, Prince Baelor advocated leniency toward Daemon Blackfyre , a position that was not favored over his uncle Bloodraven's hard line. Nonetheless, Baelor accepted the path towards war. He distinguished himself by leading the Dornish and Stormlands force which attacked the rearguard of the rebel army during the Battle of the Redgrass Field in 196 AC . Baelor's forces smashed the rebels against the shield-wall of his brother, Prince Maekar , inspiring the song " The Hammer and Anvil ". After the battle, Baelor was named Hand of the King by his father and was recognized as a good Hand and "the soul of chivalry." [3] At some point he was also given the title of Protector of the Realm.  Tourney at Ashford Meadow  In 209 AC , at the tourney at Ashford Meadow , Prince Baelor vouched for Ser Duncan the Tall because he knew Duncan's old master, Ser Arlan of Pennytree . Baelor had jousted with Arlan in a tourney at Storm's End and had unhorsed him after breaking four lances. [3] Due to Baelor's intervention Duncan was allowed to enter the lists. When Duncan attacked Prince Aerion Brightfire to defend an innocent puppeteer , Baelor had a private word with Duncan and advised him. The next day Baelor sat together with Lord Leo "Longthorn" Tyrell and Lord Ashford in judgment of Duncan. Prince Aerion demanded a trial of seven , which was granted. [3]  With the help of his squire, Egg , and Ser Raymun Fossoway , Duncan was able to recruit five men to fight for him. They needed one more, and because Baelor believed Duncan, he fought for him even though his nephew was the accuser. His brother, Maekar, was furious but Baelor said:  This man protected the weak, as every true knight must, let the gods determine if he was right or wrong. [3]   Before the melee began, Baelor advised Dunk's champions to use tourney lances, which would strike before their opponents' shorter war lances in the opening tilt. He also noted that the three Kingsguard  knights on the opposing side would be sworn not to harm him, allowing him to safely engage them. Dunk's defending party won the trial, but Baelor had received a mortal blow to his head from his brother, Prince Maekar , and died in Dunk's arms. Baelor was cremated at Ashford, per Targaryen funeral traditions. [3]   Family  Baelor married Jena Dondarrion , with whom he had two sons, Valarr and Matarys , [5] both of whom died in the Great Spring Sickness . [2] Baelor's eldest brother, Aerys I Targaryen , succeeded their father and was later succeeded by their youngest brother, Maekar , who had dealt the blow that had killed Baelor. [6] [7] [2]  Baelor's son Valarr married Kiera of Tyrosh . [5] She gave birth twice, but both sons were stillborn. [8]
