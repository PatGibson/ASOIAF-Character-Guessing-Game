[2]   History   Tysha, by Rae Lavergne  When he was thirteen years old, Tyrion Lannister met Tysha on a lonely road near Lannisport , where she was being accosted by some men. Tyrion's brother, Jaime Lannister , drove off the men while Tyrion took care of her. She was a crofter 's daughter, orphaned when her father died of an illness. Tyrion fell in love with her and they were married by a drunken septon with pigs as witnesses. [2] [3] Tyrion settled Tysha in a cottage near the Sunset Sea . [2] [4]  When Lord Tywin Lannister found out from the septon a fortnight later, he ordered Jaime to tell Tyrion that Tysha was a whore who had been paid to make Tyrion a man. Tywin then had her gang raped by his guards in their barracks; for each guard, he gave her a silver. To drive the lesson home, Tywin forced his son to be the last man, for whom Tysha was paid a gold coin, because Lannisters were worth more.

[3]  Aboard the Merling King when Sansa Stark tells Petyr Baelish that Tyrion did not poison Joffrey Baratheon , he replies that Tyrion's hands are far from clean, and that he had a wife before her. [6] Sansa tells him that Tyrion told her that. Baelish then asks her if Tyrion told her that after he grew bored of her he made a gift of her to his fathers guardsmen. Baelish tells Sansa that Tyrion might have done the same to her in time and that she should shed no tears for him. [6]  When Ser Jaime Lannister rescues his brother Tyrion from prison he confesses that Tysha was no whore, and that their father, Lord Tywin Lannister , thought the lowborn Tysha only desired the wealth of Casterly Rock . Tyrion realizes that Tysha had been genuinely in love with him, and he becomes furious with Jaime. He leaves his brother to find Varys , who is to take him out of the Red Keep . Before leaving, however, Tyrion makes his way to the chambers of Tywin in the Tower of the Hand . Tyrion demands his father tell him what happened to Tysha. Tywin does not remember, simply stating that she went "wherever whores go". When Tywin again refers to Tysha as a whore, Tyrion slays him with a crossbow and escapes.
