[1] He has a mind for counts and measures. [2]  As Lord Commander Jeor Mormont is known as the "Old Bear", Edd Tollett refers to Bowen as the "Old Pomegranate". [3]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones  Bowen is one of the guests at the dinner organized by Jeor Mormont , Lord Commander of the Night's Watch , on the eve of Tyrion Lannister 's departure. [1] He accompanies Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly , who have been assigned as stewards , when they pronounce their vows in the weirwood circle in the haunted forest  beyond the Wall . [4]   A Storm of Swords  Bowen is assigned as castellan of Castle Black by Lord Commander Mormont while the great ranging takes place. He sends letters to King's Landing requesting assistance for the Night's Watch. [5]  After Jeor Mormont's death at Craster's Keep , Bowen temporarily takes command of the Night's Watch until the election of a new Lord Commander. Appointing the ancient Ser Wynton Stout to command in his absence, Bowen leaves Castle Black to face a diversion by the wildlings who lead him to the Bridge of Skulls . [6] There, Bowen confronts the Weeper and inflicts upon him a bloody defeat costing heavy losses to the Night's Watch. Injured, Bowen is healed at the Shadow Tower and brought back to Castle Black by Ser Denys Mallister . On the way there, they meet and join with Samwell Tarly and Gilly . [7]  Bowen supports Janos Slynt after his own defeat in the election of the new Lord Commander, attempting to sway his sworn brothers and King Stannis Baratheon of Janos's worth. [7] However, Jon Snow is chosen instead. [8]   A Feast for Crows  Bowen returns to his duties as Lord Steward. [9]   A Dance with Dragons  Bowen is at first helpful to Jon, but becomes increasing angry with his decisions. These include making a baseborn lad, Satin , the Lord Commander's new steward, [10] appointing the wildling Leathers as the new master-at-arms at Castle Black, [10] and allowing wildlings to join the Watch and diminish the food supply. [11] [2]  Supported by most stewards and builders of the Watch, [12] Bowen suggests sealing the gate through the Wall at Castle Black, but his advice is rejected by Jon. [11] He tries to discourage the Lord Commander from leading some recruits to recite their vows in the haunted forest, suggesting Castle Black's sept instead. [13]  Jon tasks Bowen with collecting tolls from wildlings passing through the Wall and sending the riches to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea . [2] [14]  The final straw for Bowen is when Jon reads aloud a letter sent by Ramsay Bolton and states his intention to march on House Bolton at Winterfell , threatening the neutrality of the Night's Watch. A crying Bowen and fellow conspirators stab Jon several times in the mutiny at Castle Black . [15]   Quotes by Bowen  We need to conserve what strength remains us. Every death diminishes us, and we are stretched so thin ... Take the high ground and win the battle, my uncle used to say. No ground is higher than the Wall , Lord Commander. [11]  - Bowen to Jon Snow    The lord commander must pardon my bluntness, but I have no softer way to say this. What you propose is nothing less than treason. For eight thousand years the men of the Night's Watch have stood upon the Wall and fought these wildlings . Now you mean to let them pass, to shelter them in our castles, to feed them and clothe them and teach them how to fight. Lord Snow, must I remind you? You swore an oath. [2]  - Bowen to Jon Snow    For the Watch. [15]  - Bowen during the mutiny at Castle Black  Quotes about Bowen  Bowen knows a deal more about counting swords than he's ever known about using them. [16]  - Mance Rayder to Jon Snow    He's the man you want in front when the foes are in the field. He'll count them right up for you. A regular demon for counting, that one. [3]  - Eddison Tollett to Jon Snow    Samwell : W-what if there was someone else ? Could you s-support someone else?  Cotter : Who? Bowen Marsh? The man counts spoons. [7]  - Samwell Tarly and Cotter Pyke  References    ↑ 1.0  1.1  1.2   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 21 , Tyrion III.   ↑ 2.0  2.1  2.2  2.3   A Dance with Dragons , Chapter 53 , Jon XI.   ↑ 3.0  3.1   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 42 , Daenerys IV.   ↑   A Game of Thrones , Chapter 48 , Jon VI.   ↑   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 32 , Tyrion IV.   ↑   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 48 , Jon VI.   ↑ 7.0  7.1  7.2   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 78 , Samwell V.   ↑   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 79 , Jon XII.   ↑   A Feast for Crows , Appendix .   ↑ 10.0  10.1   A Dance with Dragons , Chapter 39 , Jon VIII.   ↑ 11.0  11.1  11.2   A Dance with Dragons , Chapter 10 , Jon III.   ↑   A Dance with Dragons , Chapter 17 , Jon IV.   ↑   A Dance with Dragons , Chapter 35 , Jon VII.   ↑   A Dance with Dragons , Chapter 58 , Jon XII.   ↑ 15.0  15.1   A Dance with Dragons , Chapter 69 , Jon XIII.   ↑   A Storm of Swords , Chapter 15 , Jon II.
