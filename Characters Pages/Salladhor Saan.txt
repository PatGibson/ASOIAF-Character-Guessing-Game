He who hurries through life hurries to his grave. [3]  - Salladhor to Davos Seaworth    Davos : How is it you come by a Pentoshi ship ? Have you gone pirate again, my lord?  Salladhor : Vile calumny. Who has suffered more from pirates than Salladhor Saan? I ask only what is due me. Much gold is owed, oh yes, but I am not without reason, so in place of coin I have taken a handsome parchment, very crisp. It bears the name and seal of Lord Alester Florent , the Hand of the King . I am made Lord of Blackwater Bay , and no vessel may be crossing my lordly waters without my lordly leave, no. And when these outlaws are trying to steal past me in the night to avoid my lawful duties and customs, why, they are no better than smugglers, so I am well within my rights to seize them. [2]  - Davos Seaworth and Salladhor   Salladhor the Beggar, that's what your king has made me. Salladhor the Smashed. Where are my ships? And my gold, where is all the gold that I was promised? When, when? On the morrow, on the new moon, when the red comet comes again? He is promising me gold and gems, always promising, but this gold I have not seen. I have his word, he is saying, oh yes, his royal word, he writes it down. Can Salladhor Saan eat the king's word? Can he quench his thirst with parchments and waxy seals? Can he tumble promises into a feather bed and fuck them till they squeal?

His head is full of dreams of the treasure he fancies lies under the Red Keep , so let us hear no more of Salladhor Saan. The day I need military counsel from a Lysene brigand is the day I put off my crown and take the black .
