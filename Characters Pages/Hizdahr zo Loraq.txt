 See also:  Images of Hizdahr zo Loraq 
 Hizdahr is a tall, very slender man [3]  with long legs. [4]  He has gentle hands, [5]  placid eyes, [6]  and a long, pale face. [3] [6]  His amber skin is flawless. [3]  He has wiry red-black hair, which he originally twisted into the shape of wings sprouting from his temples, making it appear as if his head is about to take flight. [3]  He eventually shaves off the wings. [7]  Originally, he also has a beard, which makes his long face appear even longer, with golden rings bound into it. [3]  When he cuts his hair, he shaves his beard off as well. [7]   Daenerys Targaryen  considers him to be a handsome man. [3]  He is also very limber. [3] 
 Hizdahr is a cunning [7]  and persuasive man with many friends. [8]  Ser  Barristan Selmy  believes Hizdahr does not seem to be of a jealous nature. [9]  Overall, Hizdahr is well respected within  Meereen . [2] 
 As befits his status of birth, Hizdahr often dresses in a tokar. [3] [4]  He has several tokars, including a purple tokar fringed with amethysts and pearls [3]  and a burgundy tokar, with a golden stripe and a fringe of golden beads. [4]  On some occasions, Hizdahr dresses more plainly, in a robe [2] [7]  with a quilted vest. [2] 
 
 History 
 A merchant within Meereen, Hizdahr has become famously and fabulously rich. [3]  He has visited  Volantis ,  Lys , and  Qarth . [3]  He has many friends [8]  and wields significant influence, both within Meereen and outside, [2]  stretching as far as  New Ghis . [3] 
 Hizdahr has fathered two  bastard  children; a boy and a girl. [2] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 After Daenerys takes Meereen she has the  fighting pits  closed. Hizdahr buys them at a reduced price and makes several petitions to Daenerys to reopen them. [3]  On the seventh petition he brings the former gladiators,  Khrazz ,  Barsena Blackhair ,  Camarron of the Count ,  Goghor the Giant ,  Spotted Cat ,  Fearless Ithoke  and  Belaquo Bonebreaker  who also beg Daenerys to reopen the pits. [7] 
 With the  Sons of the Harpy  continuing to cause trouble in the streets, the High Priestess of Meereen, the  Green Grace  advises Daenerys to take a husband of Ghiscari blood to placate the Meereenese and recommends Hizdahr. [2] 
 Though Daenerys is reluctant, she asks Hizdahr to bring her ninety days of peace with no more harpy killings before she will consider, and he agrees. [2]  He lives up to his end of the bargain and brings Daenerys the peace she desires, though  Skahaz mo Kandaq  advises Daenerys that he must be the one who had given the Sons their orders in the first place, which would explain why the killings stopped. [8] 
 Daenerys dismisses this, however, and marries him. Although Daenerys has no desire for him, she is desperate for peace in Meereen. [8] [5]  The pits are reopened for a series of bloodsports held in  Daznak's Pit  to celebrate the wedding. Daenerys does not like this but Hizdahr insists the fighters volunteered for the arena in a chance to win glory. Hizdahr offers her spiced locusts but she refuses.  Strong Belwas  eagerly eats them instead.
 During a fight between a boar and  Barsena Blackhair ,  Drogon  appears over the arena drawn by the stench of blood and noise of the crowd. Hizdahr becomes a king without his queen when Daenerys flees the area on Drogon's back. [6]  Belwas nearly dies from feasting on the locusts, as the spiced locusts are  laced with poison . [10] 
 Hizdahr tries to gain control of Meereen after the disappearance of Daenerys but  Grey Worm  and his  Unsullied  refuse to obey him and Ser  Barristan Selmy  considers Hizdahr vain and weak. Hizdahr removes Skahaz from command of the  Brazen Beasts  and appoints his cousin  Marghaz zo Loraq  over them. He takes up residence in  the heart  of the  Great Pyramid  during Daenerys's absence. Many of Daenerys's supporters, such as Barristan and Skahaz, later suspect Hizdahr of poisoning the locusts in hopes of getting rid of Daenerys, since he had offered her the food but did not touch it himself. [10] 
 When the  Yunkai  lords along with  Bloodbeard  present Hizdahr with the head of  Groleo  and demand the deaths of the  dragons  in return of the Meereen hostages, Hizdahr states he must ponder their request. Barristan, who is present at this parley and had served three kings ( Robert ,  Aerys  and  Jaehaerys ), thinks that none of them would have acted as meekly as Hizdahr when presented with such a threat. [1] 
 The delicate political situation leads Ser Barristan to talk with Skahaz mo Kandaq the Shavepate [1] [11]  and later with  Grey Worm . [12]  They capture Hizdahr but Barristan refuses to kill him until he is sure Hizdahr is guilty. Since his capture the  Sons of the Harpy  have resumed their shadow war and  Yunkai  has continued their siege of Meereen.
 
 Quotes by Hizdahr zo Loraq 
 Men are born to strive and suffer. Our woes only vanish when we die. [2] 
  – Hizdahr, to  Daenerys Targaryen 
 
 
 Before you came Meereen was dying. Our rulers were old men with withered cocks and crones whose puckered cunts were dry as dust. They sat atop their pyramids sipping apricot  wine  and talking of the glories of the Old Empire whilst the centuries slipped by and the very bricks of the city crumbled all around them. Custom and caution had an iron grip upon us till you awakened us with fire and blood. A new time has come, and new things are possible.  [2] 
  – Hizdahr, to  Daenerys Targaryen 
 One day all men must die, but it serves no good to dwell on death. I prefer to take each day as it comes. [2] 
  – Hizdahr, to  Daenerys Targaryen 
 Quotes about Hizdahr zo Loraq 
 I have to trust in Hizdahr. [13] 
  –  Daenerys Targaryen 
 
 
 On her terrace, in her bathing pool, the little fish would nibble at her legs as she soaked. Even they kissed with more fervor than Hizdahr zo Loraq. [2] 
  –  Daenerys Targaryen 
 
 
 Naked men felt vulnerable and were less inclined to acts of suicidal heroism. [11] 
  –  Barristan Selmy 's opinion of Hizdahr (taking note of his appearance) prior to capturing him.
