The right side of his face is gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and a heavy brow, while the left side is a burned ruin with a stump for an ear. [2] [3] [N 1] Slick black flesh is pocked with craters and deep cracks that ooze red and wet. [2] The scars extend down to his throat. [4] There is a twisted mass of scar around his right eye, which is still good. Sandor's nose is large and hooked, and his long hair is dark and thin and brushed so that it covers the right since no hair grows there. Sandor's eyes are grey and bone shows on his jaw. [2]  Sandor speaks in a rasping voice. [5] He has a temper, [5] but is dutiful. [6]  The Hound regularly wears an olive-green cloak over plain, soot-dark armor [7] and a distinctive helm sculpted into the shape of a snarling dog's head . [5] He also sometimes wears a brown roughspun tunic and studded leather jerkin. [8] Sandor wields a longsword, [9] a warhammer, [10] and a dagger. [11] His stallion is a heavy courser named Stranger . [12]   History  Sandor's childhood appears to have been overshadowed by his older brother Gregor's brutality and martial prowess. When Sandor was seven, his father explained the burns inflicted by Gregor by claiming his bedding caught fire. [2] There are rumors of a sister who died young in mysterious circumstances, and their father was killed in a hunting accident, which is also implied to have been suspicious, leaving the family estates to Gregor. [7]  Sandor left to join the Lannister household the same day Gregor came into his inheritance. [7] He claims to have killed a man when he was twelve years old, [13] possibly during Robert's Rebellion , as he was part of Tywin Lannister 's host during the Sack of King's Landing . [14] Sandor has never taken a knight 's vows. [8]  At some point Sandor was assigned as Cersei Lannister 's sworn shield , who later assigned him to Prince Joffrey Baratheon . [6]  Ser Barristan Selmy unhorsed Sandor during a tourney in 297 AC . [15]   Recent Events   The Hound vs the Mountain - by Cristi Balanescu ©  A Game of Thrones  Sandor is the bodyguard and servant of Prince Joffrey Baratheon , who regularly calls him "Dog". Queen Cersei Lannister suggests that he looks to the Hound as a surrogate father. En route from Winterfell to King's Landing, Sandor earns the enmity of Arya Stark by acting on Lannister orders to kill her friend Mycah , the son of a butcher, who is believed to have harmed Joffrey. [16]  Sandor rides well during the first day of the Hand's tourney , unhorsing Lord Renly Baratheon . [2] After that night's feast, Joffrey has Sandor escort Sansa Stark back to the Red Keep . Drunk, despite the final jousts the next day, Sandor becomes enamored with Sansa. Angry that she cannot look him in the eye due to his disfigurement, he mocks her for her polished manners, calling her a "little bird" who chirps on command. [2] Sandor defeats Ser Jaime Lannister to advance to the finals. [7] Sandor saves Ser Loras Tyrell from the wrath of his brother, Ser Gregor Clegane , during their joust. He fights heatedly with his brother, but kneels when King Robert I Baratheon commands them to stop. Loras allows Sandor to be the champion without a final joust, and the Hound is cheered by Sansa and the smallfolk . [7]  When Lord Eddard Stark attempts to take Cersei and her illegitimate children into custody with the help of the gold cloaks —unbeknownst to the fact that Commander Janos Slynt is already under the employ of the treacherous Petyr Baelish —Sandor participates in the widespread slaughter of Eddard's remaining household guard alongside his erstwhile allies, personally killing Cayn . [17] The Hound also takes Jeyne Poole into custody, placing her in Sansa's room, after breaking down her door with a warhammer. [10]    Sandor Clegane wiping Sansa Stark's bloodied lip - by Arantza Sestayo ©  After Ser Barristan Selmy is dismissed from the Kingsguard , Sandor is named as his replacement despite refusing to become a knight . [18] In this capacity he is often assigned to watch over Sansa, and despite his gruff manner, he treats her with kindness and tries to spare her from Joffrey's sadism. When Joffrey orders Ser Meryn Trant to beat her, Sandor dabs Sansa's bloody lip. [19]   A Clash of Kings   Sansa and Sandor on the eve of the Battle of the Blackwater - by Luaprata91 ©  Despite his loyalty to the new king, Joffrey I Baratheon , Sandor strategically defends Sansa Stark from Joffrey's wrath many times and is the only Kingsguard who is never commanded to beat her. [8] Sandor is present for the tourney on King Joffrey's name day as Joffrey's bodyguard. He is dismissive of the competitors, calling them gnats, that it would be a waste of effort to compete himself, and that even Joffrey could beat them. [8]  When returning from the Red Keep's godswood after meeting for the first time with Ser Dontos Hollard , Joffrey's new fool , Sansa runs into a drunk Sandor. He admires her blooming womanhood, but sees her as still a "stupid little bird […] singing all the songs they taught you". He asks her to sing "some song about knights and fair maids", and mocks Sansa's admiration of true knights , but she says she will sing for him gladly. Sansa is frightened by him during this encounter, but though he hurts her by grabbing her wrist to stop her from falling, he is also gentle when he protects her from Ser Boros Blount , and she asks Sandor why he does not let anyone call him a knight. When he takes her back unharmed to the Red Keep, he warns her she is surrounded by liars. [20]  After the battle of Oxcross , Joffrey summons Sansa, and Sandor warns her Joffrey is not pleased with her brother, Robb Stark . Sansa says she had no part Robb's treasons, at which Sandor snorts, "They trained you well, little bird." Angry at Ser Stafford Lannister 's defeat, Joffrey orders Sandor to beat Sansa, but Dontos interrupts and hits the girl with a melon. Joffrey instead has Boros punch Sansa and strike her with the flat of his sword. When Sandor objects, Joffrey orders Boros to strip Sansa naked, but he is stopped by the arrival of Tyrion Lannister with Bronn and Timett . Tyrion asks for someone to give the half-nude girl something to cover herself, so Sandor tosses his cloak to Sansa. [4]  During the riot of King's Landing , Sandor comes to the aid of Sansa when she is nearly dragged from her horse by the angry mob. Sandor's savage fury and sword fighting drives the mob away from her in fear, saving her from rape and possible murder. [21] Sansa later thanks him, and he tells her "a dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats." When Stannis Baratheon 's men burn the kingswood , Sandor tells Sansa "only cowards fight with fire." [9]  Sandor fights heroically during the battle of the Blackwater , leading the defense against a group of Stannis's archers who land on the shores of the Blackwater Rush . [22] Frightened by wildfire , however, he eventually deserts after refusing Tyrion's command to return to the fiery battlefield. [23] Before fleeing King's Landing, Sandor waits for Sansa in her chambers and drunkenly offers to take her with him, but instead settles for a song elicited at knifepoint. [11]   A Storm of Swords   Sandor Clegane vs Beric Dondarrion - by Michael Komarck ©  With Ser Mandon Moore drowning at the Blackwater and Sandor fleeing the battle, Ser Loras Tyrell joins the Kingsguard and Ser Boros Blount is restored to the white cloaks. [24] [25]  Ser Jaime Lannister considers Brienne of Tarth to be "the Hound with teats". [26]  Arya Stark includes Sandor in her list of those she wants to die. [27]  Sansa Stark wishes Sandor was still there and keeps his bloodied Kingsguard cloak hidden in a chest, [24] and she believes that he kissed her the night of the Blackwater. [28] When Sansa is forced to marry Tyrion Lannister , she considers the Imp to be uglier than the Hound. [29]  The Mad Huntsman captures the vagabond Sandor and brings him to Stoney Sept in the riverlands . The Hound is taken into custody of the brotherhood without banners , who also have Sansa's younger sister, Arya. [30] In the hollow hill , the brotherhood put Sandor on trial for various atrocities committed by Lannister soldiers, but no crime can be attributed to him personally until Arya testifies to his killing of Mycah , the butcher's boy. Since there is not enough evidence for a court trial, the brotherhood's leader, Lord Beric Dondarrion , decrees that Sandor will face him in a trial by combat . A follower of R'hllor , Beric fights with a magic flaming blade, and Sandor's left arm is burned when his shield catches fire. Despite his fear of fire, Sandor manages to defeat Beric . [31]  The brotherhood strip Sandor of most of his possessions, including the remains of his winnings from the Hand's tourney , and set him free, though he is allowed to keep his arms, armor and warhorse, Stranger . When several of the brotherhood state that Sandor should be killed, Beric says R'hllor must have a purpose for the Hound. [32] Sandor soon returns to try to reclaim his gold by force, upon which he stumbles across Arya as she tries to escape. He kidnaps her instead [33] and intends to ransom her back to her brother, Robb Stark , the King in the North , who is going to attend the wedding of Lord Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey at the Twins . [34] [35]  Sandor and Arya cross the Trident at flooded Harroway , where the Hound pays outraged ferrymen with a promissory note from Beric instead of gold. [34] They arrive at the Twins [35] shortly before the Red Wedding massacre takes place, however. [36] Amidst the fighting, Sandor kills several men—possibly including Tytos Frey and Garse Goodbrook —and incapacitates Arya to prevent her from running into the massacre. [37] [38]  Sandor hopes to find another relative to whom he can ransom Arya, possibly her aunt, Lysa Arryn , in the Vale . While traveling away from the Twins, Sandor gives the gift of mercy to a Piper archer who was wounded by Boltons during the Red Wedding. [39] Sandor and Arya stay at a village in the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon for a few weeks, but the village elder turns them away after work is finished on a palisade. With the high road to the Eyrie closed, Sandor decides to bring Arya to Ser Brynden Tully , her great-uncle at Riverrun . [39]  Seeking shelter at the inn at the crossroads , Sandor and Arya encounter two of Gregor's men and their squire , who inform them of the siege of Riverrun by House Frey . When the two groups come to blows, Sandor kills Polliver and holds off the Tickler until the torturer is killed by Arya, who also kills the squire. The hungry and inebriated Sandor is seriously injured, receiving wounds on his thigh, ribs, neck, and face, and the stump of his burned ear is sliced off. Though Arya dresses his wounds, they quickly became infected during their journey to Saltpans . Conflicted about her feelings after she leaves him off her list, Arya refuses to grant Sandor the gift of mercy despite his pleas. She rides off, leaving him under a tree by the Trident. [3]   A Feast For Crows   Arya Stark refuses Sandor the gift of mercy - by Mike S Miller ©  Reports spread of the Hound leading a pack of outlaws in a brutal spree of banditry near the Trident, [40] and there is confusion whether he has joined Beric Dondarrion 's brotherhood . [41] Witnesses state a roaring brute in a hound's head helm led the vicious raid on Saltpans . Ser Bonifer Hasty , Ser Kevan Lannister , and Lord Randyll Tarly intend to bring outlaws like Sandor to justice near Darry , Harrenhal , and Maidenpool . [42] [43] [44]  During dinner at Darry, Ser Lyle Crakehall claims to have been moved by the distress of Mariya Darry and Amerei Frey , and gives them his word that once Riverrun has fallen he shall return to hunt down the Hound and kill him for them, adding that dogs do not frighten him. [45]  Seeking Sansa Stark , Brienne of Tarth acts on information that she received from Timeon of the Brave Companions that Sansa had been carried away by the Hound. Her travels with Septon Meribald take her to a septry on the Quiet Isle . The Elder Brother of the monastery informs her that it was the younger sister that Sandor made off with, Arya Stark . The Elder Brother knows they were headed for Saltpans , but he states the Hound is dead, "by the sword, as he had lived" and he buried him personally and left his hound helm as a marker — a mistake, as someone else found and claimed it, and went on, with others, to rape and kill at Saltpans. The Elder Brother tells Brienne she would have pitied Sandor if she had seen him at the end, crying in pain and begging for the gift of mercy . He tells her the Hound died in his arms, and Sandor Clegane is at rest. He also tells her Sandor's big black stallion, Stranger is in their stables. [46]  While at the crossroads inn , Brienne encounters a group of broken men led by Rorge , who wears Sandor's hound helm. [47] Prior to the capture of Harrenhal , Rorge, Biter , and other former Brave Companions had traveled east to seek ship at Saltpans. Rorge had taken Sandor's snarling dog helm from his grave site, and Rorge was responsible for Sandor's alleged atrocities, such as the raid on Saltpans. Rorge is slain in a duel with Brienne. [47]  When the brotherhood returns to the inn, Lem Lemoncloak takes Sandor's helm from Rorge's corpse. Thoros of Myr advises Lem to abandon the helm, seeing it as a symbol of Sandor's rage, but the bitter Lem refuses. This new Hound serves Lady Stoneheart . [48]  With the siege of Riverrun ended, Lyle Crakehall tells Ser Jaime Lannister he is going to hunt down Beric and the Hound. [49]   Gravedigger  Many readers of the series believe that there are hints in what the Elder Brother has said about the Hound to Brienne of Tarth , that the Elder Brother considers "the Hound " to be simply an aspect of Sandor's personality — the same way that “the Cobbler Above” is an aspect of the Smith , who in turn is an aspect of the one God — and that Sandor himself may have survived and is living as a novice on the Quiet Isle 's monastery. Some believe Sandor is the novice gravedigger espied by Brienne. [46]   Quotes by Sandor   Sandor Clegane with a little bird - Artwork by Asiulus ©  Eddard : You rode him down.  Sandor : He ran. But not very fast. [16]   – Sandor and Eddard Stark regarding Mycah    Spare me your empty little compliments, girl ... and your ser's. I am no knight . I spit on them and their vows. My brother is a knight. [50]   – Sandor, to Sansa Stark    I was younger than you, six, maybe seven. A woodcarver set up shop in the village under my father's keep, and to buy favor he sent us gifts. The old man made marvelous toys. I don't remember what I got, but it was Gregor's gift I wanted. A wooden knight, all painted up, every joint pegged separate and fixed with strings, so you could make him fight. Gregor is five years older than me, the toy was nothing to him, he was already a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his knight, but there was no joy to it, I tell you. I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me. There was a brazier in the room. Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his arm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed. You saw how strong he is. Even then, it took three grown men to drag him off me. The septons preach about the seven hells. What do they know? Only a man who's been burned knows what hell is truly like. [2]   – Sandor, to Sansa Stark    Sansa : Why do you let people call you a dog? You won't let anyone call you a knight .  Sandor : I like dogs better than knights... A hound will die for you, but never lie to you. And he'll look you straight in the face. [20]   – Sandor, to Sansa Stark    Killing is the sweetest thing there is. [9]   – Sandor, to Sansa Stark    What do you think a knight is for, girl? You think it's all taking favors from ladies and looking fine in gold plate? Knights are for killing. I killed my first man at twelve. I've lost count of how many I've killed since then. High lords with old names, fat rich men dressed in velvet, knights puffed up like bladders with their honors, yes, and women and children too—they're all meat, and I'm the butcher. [9]   – Sandor, to Sansa Stark    Sandor : If there are gods, they made sheep so wolves could eat mutton, and they made the weak for the strong to play with.  Sansa : True knights protect the weak.  Sandor : There are no true knights, no more than there are gods. If you can't protect yourself, die and get out of the way of those who can. Sharp steel and strong arms rule this world, don't ever believe any different.  Sansa : You're awful.   Sandor : I'm honest. It's the world that's awful. [9]   – Sandor and Sansa Stark    I could keep you safe. They’re all afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I’d kill them. [11]   – Sandor, to Sansa Stark    I’ve killed a lot more than him, I promise you. You think that makes me some monster. Well, maybe it does, but I saved your sister’s life too. The day the mob pulled her off her horse, I cut through them and brought her back to the castle, else she would have gotten what Lollys Stokeworth got. And she sang for me. You didn’t know that, did you? Your sister sang me a sweet little song. [34]   – Sandor, to Arya Stark    Even a dog gets tired of being kicked. [34]   – Sandor, to Arya Stark    Archer : You're Joffrey's dog.  Sandor : My own dog now. [39]   – Sandor, to another survivor of the Red Wedding , the dying bowman in service to Marq Piper    Bugger that. Bugger him. Bugger you. [3]   – Sandor, to the Tickler , before the fight at the inn at the crossroads   Quotes about Sandor  He is a dog, just as he says. A half-wild, mean-tempered dog that bites any hand that tries to pet him, and yet will savage any man who tries to hurt his masters. [9]   – thoughts of Sansa Stark    He is no true knight , but he saved me all the same. Save him if you can, and gentle the rage inside him. [51]   – Sansa Stark , praying to the Mother during the battle of the Blackwater    I wish the Hound were here. The night of the battle, Sandor Clegane had come to her chambers to take her from the city, but Sansa had refused. Sometimes she lay awake at night, wondering if she’d been wise. She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest beneath her summer silks. She could not say why she’d kept it. The Hound had turned craven, she heard it said; at the height of the battle, he got so drunk the Imp had to take his men. But Sansa understood. She knew the secret of his burned face. It was only the fire he feared. That night, the wildfire had set the river itself ablaze, and filled the very air with green flame. Even in the castle, Sansa had been afraid. Outside… she could scarcely imagine it. [28]   – thoughts of Sansa Stark    Sandor Clegane would kill us all gladly, but not in our sleep. [32]   – Beric Dondarrion , to Watty    When a dog goes bad, the fault lies with his master. [41]   – Kevan Lannister to Cersei Lannister    Sandor had been hard and brutal, yes, but it was his big brother who was the real monster in House Clegane . [45]   – thoughts of Jaime Lannister    Both men were large and powerful, but Sandor Clegane was much quicker, and fought with a savagery that Lyle Crakehall could not hope to match. [45]   – thoughts of Jaime Lannister    As the boy's lips touched her own she found herself thinking of another kiss. She could still remember how it felt, when his cruel mouth pressed down on her own. He had come to Sansa in the darkness as green fire filled the sky. He took a song and a kiss, and left me nothing but a bloody cloak. [52]   – thoughts of Sansa Stark    Sandor Clegane was a man in torment. [53]   – Thoros of Myr   Family        Founder of House Clegane                               Ser Clegane                                          Gregor "the Mountain"  Sandor "the Hound"  Daughter                   Notes    ↑  A Clash of Kings , Sansa III incorrectly states that it is the right side of his face which is burned.
