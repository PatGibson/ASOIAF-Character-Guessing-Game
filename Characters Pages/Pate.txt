 Character and Appearance 
 Originally from the  Westerlands , Pate is named after the folk hero  Spotted Pate , the pig boy, but he hates it when people refer to the story. [2]  He is pale, soft, and pasty-faced. [3]  Pate used to dream of being a  maester  in a castle, respected and admired; however, he has been at the Citadel for five years, but has not earned a single link for his maester's chain. His duties include looking after old senile  Archmaester   Walgrave , who sometimes thinks he is someone called  Cressen , and tending the  ravens  in the  Ravenry . The  white ravens  know his name, and often  quork  "Pate, Pate, Pate" whenever they see him. Pate is afraid of Maester  Gormon , who once accused him of theft. [2] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Feast for Crows 
 Pate has met a person who calls himself an  Alchemist , who has promised Pate a  golden dragon coin  if he brings him the  personal key of Walgrave  in three days. The personal key of an archmaester can open any lock in the Citadel. Pate thinks about this offer for two days, as he does not want to be a thief. However, he needs the gold to claim the maidenhood of  Rosey , the youngest serving girl of the  Quill and Tankard  inn. Pate dreams of running away with Rosey, and serving the smallfolk with the medical knowledge he has learned at the Citadel. [2] 
 On the third day, Pate is with his friends,  Alleras ,  Mollander ,  Armen , and  Roone , in the  Quill and Tankard , celebrating Alleras's newly acquired link. They meet  Leo Tyrell , another novice who thinks very much of himself and is not liked by the others. Leo mocks them, and claims he will have Rosey. Shortly afterwards, the other boys go back to the Citadel, leaving Leo and Pate, who is waiting for the Alchemist. [2] 
 Eventually, Pate thinks that the Alchemist will not show up, and heads back to the Citadel. Outside the pub, he runs into the Alchemist, who has Pate follow him into a narrow alley. The Alchemist gives Pate the coin, and Pate bites down on it as he has seen others do with gold coins. Pate asks the Alchemist to show his face, which is revealed to be that of a young man. He has a slight scar on his right cheek and a hooked nose, while his hair is thick, black and curly. [4]  Pate does not recognize him, and asks who he is, and the Alchemist replies, "A stranger.  No one . Truly." Pate gives the Alchemist the key, thus proving himself to be a thief. When Pate leaves, he falls to the ground,  his legs weak and his heart hammering , and dies. His last thoughts are of Rosey. [2] 
 Later,  Samwell Tarly  comes to the Citadel and meets Alleras, Leo Tyrell, and a boy calling himself Pate, "like the pig boy". [3] 
 
 Quotes 
 He had no time to think about it, to weigh his choices. The  alchemist  was walking away. Pate had to follow or lose  Rosey  and the dragon both, forever. He followed. [2]
