 History 
 Chett was born around  Hag's Mire . His father collected leeches and sold them to  maesters , and Chett learned the trade from his father. He was an ugly boy and so girls did not take interest in him. Chett picked flowers for a girl named  Bessa  who had slept with every boy in their town, but she spurned and insulted him. Chett became so angry that he killed her. He was caught by  Walder Rivers , one of Lord  Walder Frey 's bastards, and sent to the  Wall . He has been a  steward  assisting Maester  Aemon  for four years. [1] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Game of Thrones 
 At the  Wall , Chett is a  steward  whose job is to care for the ravens and old Maester  Aemon , with  Clydas . This was a rather comfortable position, but it is taken away from him by  Jon Snow , who advises Aemon that the job is better suited for the literate  Samwell Tarly . [2]  After that, Chett is assigned to the kennels. [3] 
 
 A Clash of Kings 
 Chett takes care of the dogs on the  great ranging   beyond the Wall . He and  Lark the Sisterman  come upon Jon when he is talking to  Gilly , one of  Craster 's wives. [4]  Jon later overhears Chett and Lark talking about mutiny. [5] 
 
 A Storm of Swords 
 Morale is low during the great ranging. Fourteen [1]  brothers conspire to desert, including the ringleader Chett,  Dirk ,  Softfoot ,  Ollo Lophand ,  Sweet Donnel Hill , Lark the Sisterman,  Rolley of Sisterton ,  Clubfoot Karl ,  Maslyn ,  Small Paul , and  Sawwood . To make sure they will not be caught, they plan to kill some of their Night's Watch brothers:
 
 Lord Commander  Jeor Mormont , to allow command to go to Ser  Ottyn Wythers , whom they expect to withdraw to the Wall instead of going after the deserters. 
 Blane , a stern officer of the  Shadow Tower . 
 Grubbs  and  Aethan , the men who have drawn watch. 
 Dywen  and  Bannen , to prevent the deserters from being tracked. 
 Samwell Tarly , to prevent a raven with the message of what they had done from reaching the Wall. 
 Chett intends to murder Samwell himself. After the killings he plans to set free his dogs, which would frighten the horses, running them off. Chett has not fed the dogs for a few days so they will be extra fierce. In the confusion that would follow, the deserters could flee with the remaining horses and the food they had hoarded. [1] 
 Unfortunately for the conspirators, it begins to snow a few hours before they intend to set their plan into motion. Chett realizes that in fresh snow they would be easily followed and would not make good time, so he cancels the plan. Regardless, he decides to kill Samwell out of spite. However, at the moment Chett finds Sam they hear three horn blows, signalling that  Others  have been sighted. [1] 
 When  wights  attack the Night's Watch, beginning the  fight at the Fist , a trusting Samwell asks Chett for help in sending off  ravens , but the kennel keeper runs away. [6]  Chett is killed during the battle, as Sam later encounters him as a wight at an unnamed  wildling  village. A flock of ravens attacks the undead Chett and other wights, allowing Samwell to be rescued by  Coldhands . [7] 
 
 Quotes 
 He could see  Bessa 's face floating before him. It wasn't the knife I wanted to put in you, he wanted to tell her. I picked you flowers, wild roses and tansy and goldencups, it took me all morning. [1]
