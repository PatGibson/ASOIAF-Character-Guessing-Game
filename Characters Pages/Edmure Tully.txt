[4]  Edmure is fond of smiling [4] and pretty girls, [6] but is sulky and sullen when angered. [5] According to Catelyn, Edmure dislikes singers because one once slept with a girl fancied by Edmure. [7] According to Tom of Sevenstreams , Edmure once drank too much and was unable to "perform", so Tom made a mocking song about a floppy fish.

[11] Edmure owns tunics embroidered with silver fish [5] or striped in red and blue, [12] as well as a quilted doublet of red wool with an embroidered leaping trout. [13]   History  Edmure was born as the third child and only living son of Lord Hoster Tully and Minisa Whent . Edmure's mother died while giving birth to a baby brother, who also died. [14]  As a youth, Edmure was known as hot headed but good hearted. He had a number of friends who had similar characteristics, most notably Marq Piper . Edmure once broke his arm after falling from an elm in Riverrun 's godswood . [4] When Lords Tytos Blackwood and Jonos Bracken visited Hoster to discuss their feud, young Edmure, his sisters, and Petyr Baelish drank wine when the adults were preoccupied. [15] Edmure dubbed Petyr as "Littlefinger", on account of House Baelish 's holdings on the Fingers and Petyr's short stature. [16] Because Edmure served as Brandon Stark 's squire when Petyr dueled Brandon, the wounded Petyr sent Edmure away when he tried to visit afterward. [17]  Hoster refused an offer by Lord Walder Frey to wed Edmure to one of his daughters. [18] Princess Arianne Martell wanted to accept Hoster's offer for her to meet Edmure at Riverrun, but Doran Martell , Prince of Dorne , declined because of a secret marriage pact . [19]   Recent Events  A Game of Thrones   Edmure Tully by Enife ©  Edmure takes command of the riverlands due to the illness of his father, Lord Hoster Tully .

[23] Tywin's son, Jaime, smashes Vance and Piper below the Golden Tooth and then advances to Riverrun , where he takes Edmure prisoner before its walls in a crushing defeat . [22]  While Jaime besieges Riverrun, Edmure's nephew, Robb Stark , marches south with northmen , Freys , Mallisters , and other warriors. [24] Robb captures Jaime in the Whispering Wood [24] and then destroys Jaime's army in the Battle of the Camps , during which Lord Tytos Blackwood leads a sortie from Riverrun which rescues Edmure. [25] Edmure is wounded in the neck during one of the battles. [4] During the war council held at Riverrun, the northern and river lords proclaim Robb to be King in the North . [4]   A Clash of Kings  Edmure thinks the red comet is an omen of victory for Riverrun, and he convinces King Robb to give the river lords leave to return to their castles and defend their lands. [11] When Robb decides to take his northern horse west into the westerlands , he tasks Edmure with holding Riverrun and guarding his rear. Edmure shelters the frightened smallfolk in Riverrun when Tywin Lannister burns and pillages through the riverlands, although this reduces Riverrun's supplies. [5]  After Lord Roose Bolton takes the crossroads , Edmure commands Ser Helman Tallhart to leave the Twins and aid Roose in retaking Harrenhal from Tywin. Edmure, Lord Blackwood, and Lord Jonos Bracken believe Tywin can be caught between Riverrun and Harrenhal once Robb returns from the west. [5]  Tyrion Lannister includes four false envoys in the party escorting Ser Cleos Frey from King's Landing back to Riverrun.

Edmure moves Jaime to the dungeon and places Cleos in Jaime's old tower cell.

While Robb publicly praises Edmure in the Great Hall for Stone Mill, the king and Ser Brynden Tully berate Edmure in a private audience chamber for disrupting Robb's plan. According to them, Edmure, in defending the Red Fork, unknowingly thwarted Robb's plans. Robb argues he wanted Tywin to cross the river and then be trapped in the westerlands by the Stark and Frey cavalry there. However, Robb did not reveal this plan to Edmure beforehand. By pushing Tywin's army back, Edmure inflicted enough of a delay for messengers from Bitterbridge to reach Tywin with word of what was happening to the south, allowing Tywin to turn his army around and aid the Tyrells and his grandson, King Joffrey I Baratheon , in the Battle of the Blackwater . Edmure offers to lead the van in the next battle. [27]  After Lord Rickard Karstark murders Willem Lannister and Tion Frey , two of Robb's prisoners, as well as some of Riverrun's guards , Edmure advises Robb to keep Rickard as a hostage.

He fails to ignite Hoster's funeral boat with three fire arrows, although Brynden succeeds in doing so. Edmure is offended when Lord Walder Frey sends a cripple, Lame Lothar Frey , and a bastard, Walder Rivers , to Riverrun. [32] With Robb having broken his alliance with House Frey by wedding Jeyne Westerling , Edmure agrees to wed one of Walder's daughters, Roslin , to make amends for the Battle of the Fords and for Robb's marriage. [32]  The Brave Companions capture Jaime, chop off his sword hand, [33] and bring him to Lord Roose Bolton at Harrenhal . [34] Instead of returning Jaime to Edmure and Robb, Roose sends him on to King's Landing, [35] hoping that Lord Tywin Lannister will not blame Roose for the actions of Vargo Hoat . [36]  At Hag's Mire during the journey to the Twins , Edmure is present when Robb plans his siege of Moat Cailin and announces a successor; [9] according to a semi-canon source this is Robb's half brother, Jon Snow . [37]  Edmure, Robb, Catelyn, and their retinue receive guest right when they arrive at the Twins. Edmure had thought Walder would offer him an ugly or half-witted girl just to spite him and Robb, but Roslin turns out to be beautiful. [6] Edmure is considerate to his new bride, but Roslin has a fixed smile [38] and cries before the wedding [6] and at the ensuing feast. [38] Edmure and Roslin leave the hall to consummate the marriage in the bedding custom. Edmure is distracted by fiddlers outside his guest chamber and by Roslin within. [12] Meanwhile, Freys and Boltons attack the guests remaining in the hall in what becomes known as the Red Wedding .

[39] His closest friend, Ser Marq Piper , is also held captive at Riverrun, [40] while Patrek Mallister is used by Black Walder Frey to force the surrender of Lord Jason Mallister at Seagard . [41] [12]  After the death of King Joffrey I Baratheon , the new king, his brother Tommen I , issues bills of attainder against Edmure and his uncle, Brynden Tully. Riverrun is to be granted to Ser Emmon Frey once the castle is surrendered by Brynden the Blackfish. [42] Edmure's remaining sister, Lysa Arryn , is thrown to her death from the Eyrie by their childhood friend, Lord Petyr Baelish . [15]   A Feast of Crows  Ser Ryman Frey brings Edmure to the siege of Riverrun , whose castellan is Edmure's uncle, Ser Brynden Tully . Ryman threatens to hang Edmure if Riverrun does not surrender. Every day Edmure is made to stand at the gallows but Brynden refuses to surrender and Ryman does not make good on his threats. The siege continues until Ser Jaime Lannister arrives to take over command. Ser Perwyn Frey has told Ser Daven Lannister that Roslin Frey is fond of Edmure and now pregnant. [43] Jaime parleys with Brynden, who refuses to exchange Edmure for Westerlings . Ser Emmon Frey , the new titular Lord of Riverrun , wants Edmure hanged at once. [12]  Taking command of the siege, Jaime sends Ryman back to the Twins and takes Edmure as his own prisoner. The Kingslayer releases a thin and filthy Edmure, Lewys Piper draws a tub of bathwater for him, and Pia gives him fresh clothes. Reminding Edmure that he is lord of House Tully , Jaime explains that if Riverrun is yielded then the garrison and smallfolk will be spared, and that Edmure and his family will be able to live in comfort at Casterly Rock . Jaime also suggests joining the Night's Watch as an alternative. If Edmure does not yield Riverrun, however, Jaime will use river lords in the first wave of an assault of the castle, and defenders would be killed. If Edmure and Roslin's child would be born, Jaime would send the child to him in a catapult. Afterward, Jaime leaves Edmure to his bath, with the sole company of Tom of Sevenstreams playing " The Rains of Castamere ". [12]  Having entered Riverrun, Edmure waits most of the day before surrendering the castle. Jaime learns the next morning that during the confusion, Edmure raised the Water Gate to allow Brynden to escape into the Red Fork . After Riverrun is handed over, Edmure is sent west with an armed escort to begin life as a hostage of House Lannister . Their group is joined by the Westerlings, and Ser Forley Prester 's best archers are to shoot Edmure and Jeyne Westerling if they attempt to escape. [13]   A Dance with Dragons  During the siege of Raventree , Jaime mentions to Lord Tytos Blackwood that after Roslin gives birth she and the child will be sent to join Edmure at Casterly Rock. [44]   Quotes by Edmure   Edmure Tully by The Mico ©  How can we talk of peace while the Lannisters spread like a pestilence over my father's domains , stealing his crops and slaughtering his people? [11]  - Edmure to Robb Stark    Catelyn: Who are all these folk ? Edmure: My people. They were afraid. [5]  - Catelyn Stark and Edmure   Edmure : Tell Father I have gone to make him proud.  Catelyn : He was always proud of you, Edmure. And he loves you fiercely. Believe that.   Edmure : I mean to give him better reason than mere birth. [10]  – Edmure and Catelyn Tully    Brynden : I am the last man in the Seven Kingdoms to tell anyone who they must wed, Nephew. Nonetheless, you did say something of making amends for your Battle of the Fords .  Edmure : I had in mind a different sort of amends. Single combat with the Kingslayer . Seven years of penance as a begging brother . Swimming the sunset sea with my legs tied. The Others take you all! Very well, I'll wed the wench . As amends. [32]  – Brynden Tully and Edmure   Roslin : Lord Edmure, I hope I am not a disappointment to you.  Edmure : You are a delight to me, my lady. And ever will be, I know. [6]  - Roslin Frey and Edmure   This was my father's solar. He ruled the riverlands from here , wisely and well. The light was good there, and whenever he looked up from his work he could see the river. When his eyes were tired he would have Cat read to him. Littlefinger and I built a castle out of wooden blocks once, there beside the door. You will never know how sick it makes me to see you in this room, Kingslayer. You will never know how much I despise you. [13]  – Edmure to Jaime Lannister  Quotes about Edmure   Tobias Menzies as Edmure in Game of Thrones  Is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could march? I am told the Kingslayer went through him like an axe through ripe cheese. [18]  – Walder Frey , to Catelyn Stark    Only my sweet brother would crowd all these useless mouths into a castle that might soon be under siege. Catelyn knew that Edmure had a soft heart; sometimes she thought his head was even softer. She loved him for it, yet still ... [5]  – Catelyn Stark 's thoughts   You owe His Grace your thanks for his forbearance. He played out that mummer’s farce in the Great Hall so as not to shame you before your own people. Had it been me I would have flayed you for your stupidity rather than praising this folly of the fords . [27]  – Brynden Tully to Edmure   Robb : We must win back the Freys . With them, we still have some chance of success , however small. Without them, I see no hope.

[27]  - Robb Stark and Catelyn Stark    Tom : Lord Hoster was hanging outlaws before you were shaving. And that son of his ... a man who hates music can't be trusted, I always say.

Jaime : Ser Edmure is on his way to Casterly Rock as my captive. His wife will remain at the Twins until their child is born. Then she and the babe will join him. So long as he does not attempt escape or plot rebellion, Edmure will live a long life.  Tytos : Long and bitter. A life without honor. Until his dying day, men will say he was afraid to fight.   Jaime (thinking): Unjustly. It was his child he feared for.
