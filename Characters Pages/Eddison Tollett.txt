[2] He has a dry and pessimistic sense of humor. [1] [3] He is well liked by his brothers in the Night's Watch . [4]   History  Dolorous Edd appears to have been born to a lesser branch of the House Tollet , as he speaks of being raised in a crude house such as the poorer of the smallfolk might have. He was a squire recruited to the Night's Watch by Yoren , who told him women could not resist a man in uniform, leaving out the Night's Watch vow of celibacy. [1] [5]   Recent Events  A Clash of Kings   Dolorous Edd - by Amok ©  Edd is part of the the great ranging  beyond the Wall . [3]  Jeor Mormont , Lord Commander of the Night's Watch , trusts his horse to Edd, and he also has Edd retrieve his axe to give as a gift to Craster . [3] When Jon Snow joins Qhorin Halfhand 's mission into the Frostfangs , Qhorin reminds Jeor that Edd can serve the Lord Commander as his steward. [6]   A Storm of Swords  Edd survives when wights attack the Fist of the First Men , helping Samwell Tarly retreat. [7] They are among the survivors to make it back to Craster's Keep . [8]  Once at Craster's Keep Edd is one of the few men that takes Sam seriously when he tells the men he slew an Other with his dragonglass dagger. [7] Edd, along with Dywen , makes Sam and Grenn tell Lord Commander Mormont the tale. [8] After the death of the Lord Commander during the mutiny at Craster's Keep over food, Edd flees with Grenn, Giant and other loyalists back to the Wall for fear of being killed by mutineers. [9]  When the Weeper starts his assault near the Shadow Tower , Bowen Marsh assembles the garrison of Castle Black, along with Edd, to aid Ser Denys Mallister . [10] During the battle beneath the Wall , the defenders name a straw sentinel after Edd. [11]  Against his wishes, Edd receives a few votes during the election of the new Lord Commander. [10] Edd later puts forth Jon Snow 's name instead, and Jon is chosen by the black brothers. [12]   A Feast for Crows  Edd says farewell to Sam when the boy leaves Castle Black. [13]   A Dance with Dragons  Edd carries on his duties as Lord Commander Snow's steward. He is one of the men brought along as muscle to assist Jon in escorting Janos Slynt out of Castle Black to carry out his duties as garrison commander of Greyguard . Edd and Iron Emmett escort Janos outside for his execution. [14]  While riding to Mole's Town , Jon jokes that the solemn face carved by wildlings on an ash heart tree resembles Edd. [15]  Eventually, Lord Commander Snow assigns Emmett to Long Barrow , where Jon sent the spearwives , with Edd as his steward and second in command. [16]  Satin replaces Edd at Castle Black. [17]  Edd briefly returns to Castle Black with six wagons so more spearwives can be transported to Long Barrow. [18]   Quotes by Edd  The dead are likely dull fellows, full of tedious complaints—the ground's too cold, my gravestone should be larger, why does he get more worms than I do... [1]  - Edd to Jon Snow    Some dogs crawled atop me during the night. My cloak was almost dry when one of them pissed in it. Or perhaps it was Brown Bernarr . Have you noticed that the rain stopped the instant I had a roof above me? It will start again now that I’m back out. Gods and dogs alike delight to piss on me. [3]  - Edd to Jon Snow    There are worse ways to die than warm and drunk. I knew a brother drowned himself in wine once. It was a poor vintage, though, and his corpse did not improve it. [19]  - Edd to Jon Snow    Once they figure a way to work a dead horse , we'll be next. Likely I'll be the first too. 'Edd' they'll say, 'dying's no excuse for laying down no more, so get on up and take this spear, you've got the watch tonight.' Well, I shouldn't be so gloomy. Might be I'll die before they work it out. [8]  – Edd to Samwell Tarly    Edd : I never win anything. The gods always smiled on Watt , though. When the wildlings knocked him off the Bridge of Skulls , somehow he landed in a nice deep pool of water. How lucky was that, missing all those rocks?  Grenn : Was it a long fall? Did landing in the pool of water save his life?   Edd : No. He was dead already, from that axe in his head. Still, it was pretty lucky, missing the rocks. [10]  – Edd and Grenn    I just want to say to whoever is voting for me that I would certainly make an awful Lord Commander . But so would all these others. [10]  - Edd to his black brothers   Cotter : We'll defend the Wall to the last man.  Edd : Probably me. [20]  - Cotter Pyke and Edd   Samwell:  Jon wants to see me?  Edd : As to that, I could not say. I never wanted to see half the things I’ve seen, and I’ve never seen half the things I wanted to. I don’t think wanting comes into it. You’d best go all the same. [13]  – Samwell Tarly and Edd   My old septon used to say that books are dead men talking. Dead men should keep quiet, is what I say. No one wants to hear a dead man’s yabber. [14]  - Edd to Jon Snow    Place was overrun with rats when we moved in. The spearwives killed the nasty buggers. Now the place is overrun with spearwives. There’s days I want the rats back. [18]  - Edd to Jon Snow  Quotes about Edd  Edd, fetch me a block.
