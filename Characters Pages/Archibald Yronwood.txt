 See also:  Images of Archibald Yronwood 
 Archibald is six-and-a-half-feet tall, broad of shoulder and huge of belly. He has legs like tree trunks, hands the size of hams, and no neck. His arms are thick enough to rival even  Strong Belwas . [4]  Arch's bald head reminds others of a stone. [1] [4] 
 Arch wields a spiked warhammer, [5]  a dagger, [6]  and fine armor. [2]  He is a better fighter than  Quentyn Martell  or  Gerris Drinkwater . [2]  He is aggressive at dicing [2]  and easily becomes seasick. [1] 
 
 History 
 Archibald lost all his hair from a childhood malady. [1]  He was first called the big man by his cousin, Ser  Cletus Yronwood . [1] 
 
 Recent Events 
 A Feast for Crows 
 Doran Martell ,  Prince of Dorne , tells his daughter, Princess  Arianne Martell , that her younger brother, Prince  Quentyn Martell , has been sent with a small party on a dangerous voyage. [7] 
 
 A Dance with Dragons 
 Quentyn has been sent to wed  Daenerys Targaryen , now the Queen of  Meereen . The prince has been joined by Ser Archibald, his cousin Ser  Cletus Yronwood , Maester  Kedry , Ser  Gerris Drinkwater , and Ser  Willam Wells . [1]  Arch becomes seasick during the voyage, with Kedry treating him for four days in  Lys . [1]  The party's ship,  Meadowlark , is ambushed by corsairs off the coast of the  Disputed Lands , and Cletus, Kedry, and Willam are slain. [1] 
 In  Volantis , the survivors are unsuccessful in hiring a ship that will transport them to Meereen. Archibald suggests taking the  demon road , but his idea is dismissed in favor of Gerris's plan to join the  Windblown , a  sellsword  company on its way to the city. [1]  To hide his identity Archibald goes by the name "Greenguts", while Quentyn pretends to be his squire, "Frog". The three companions sell their fine armor in Volantis and acquire battered armor from the Windblown. [2]  When Quentyn, Gerris, and Arch discuss deserting the Windblown after the  siege of Astapor , they are summoned by the  Tattered Prince . The captain orders them to join a party of  Westerosi  mercenaries who are to pretend that they betrayed the company and want to join Daenerys. [2] 
 The Dornishmen present themselves to Daenerys in Meereen and the prince reveals their reason to be there, but Daenerys declines Quentyn's offer for marriage since she is about to wed  Hizdahr zo Loraq . The queen advises the Dornishmen to return to  Dorne  but they are determined to stay. [8] 
 Archibald and Gerris reluctantly help Quentyn in his scheme to take the dragons after Daenerys vanishes from Meereen. [6]  Arch wears a bull's mask while disguised as one of the  Brazen Beasts , and he uses his warhammer to break a lock deep within the  Great Pyramid . [5]  When  Rhaegal  mortally burns Quentyn with  dragonflame , Archibald tries to beat the flames with his bare hands but to little success. Both Archibald and Gerris are arrested but neither gives resistance in their grief. [9] 
 Ser  Barristan Selmy , the  Hand of the Queen , visits the Dornishmen in their prison cells and tells them that they are to be hanged for treason. Gerris blames everything that has happened on Daenerys but Arch manages to calm him down. The big man tells Barristan what happened when they tried to capture the dragons and also that Quentyn promised  Pentos  to the Tattered Prince for the Windblown's help in the plan. The old knight sees opportunity and offers the prisoners a ship to Dorne and Quentyn's bones if they deliver a message to the Windblown's leader. Barristan wants the Dornishmen to tell the Tattered Prince that he will be given Pentos if he helps in freeing the Meereenese prisoners held by the  Yunkai 'i. Gerris is reluctant, but Archibald accepts and convinces his younger companion to go along this plan. [9] 
 
 Quotes by Archibald 
 I am always prepared to fight. [2] 
  - Archibald to  Quentyn Martell 
 
 
 Daenerys : Greenguts is a queer sort of name. 
 Archibald : A jape, Your Grace. From the ships. I was greensick the whole way from  Volantis . Heaving and ... well, I shouldn't say. [4] 
  -  Daenerys Targaryen  and Archibald
 
 
 Gerris : Even if  the queen  returns, she'll still be married. 
 Archibald : Not if I give King Harzoo a little smack with my hammer. 
 Quentyn :  Hizdahr . His name is Hizdahr. 
 
 Archibald : One kiss from my hammer and no one will care what his name was. [6] 
  -  Gerris Drinkwater , Archibald, and  Quentyn Martell 
 
 
 Archibald : Fire and water don't mix, and that's a fact. You get a good cookfire lit, blazing away nice, then it starts to piss down rain and next thing your wood is sodden and your flames are dead. 
 Gerris :  Dragons  are not made of wood, Arch. 
 
 Archibald : Some are. That old King  Aegon , the randy one, he built wooden dragons to conquer  us . That ended bad, though. [5] 
  - Archibald and  Gerris Drinkwater 
 Quotes about Archibald 
 The sellswords  loved Greenguts, who bet as fearlessly as he fought, but with far less success. [2] 
  - thoughts of  Quentyn Martell 
 
 
 The  Dornishmen  were  knights , at least in name, though only Yronwood impressed him as having the true steel.  Drinkwater  had a pretty face, a glib tongue, and a fine head of hair. [9] 
  - thoughts of  Barristan Selmy
