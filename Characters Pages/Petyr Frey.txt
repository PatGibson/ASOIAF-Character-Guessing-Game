History  Petyr is only a year or two older than Robb Stark , but he was married at the age of ten to Mylenda Caron , a woman three times his age. [3]   Recent Events  A Storm of Swords  Petyr, together with his brother "Black" Walder Frey , and his father, Ser Ryman Frey , are sent to greet Robb Stark 's arrival at the Twins for the wedding of Lord Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey . Robb's direwolf, Grey Wind , tries to attack them, scaring the greeters' horses and dropping Petyr into the mud. [3] During the Red Wedding he passes out drunk trying to compete with Greatjon Umber . [4]  After the Red Wedding, Petyr is captured by the brotherhood without banners while wandering around with some camp followers and is kept for a ransom of one hundred gold pieces. Merrett Frey volunteers to pay the ransom at Oldstones , hoping to gain favor with Ryman's branch of House Frey and not be thrown out of the Twins when Lord Walder Frey finally dies. Merrett is shown Petyr's hanged body, however, and Merrett is himself hanged soon after for his participation in the Red Wedding.
